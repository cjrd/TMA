times crises one the ways that leaders can demonstrate the quality their leadership with speeches that clarify heal and point the way ahead for their followers the tragic events sept presented just such challenge president george bush and prime minister tony blair and both rose the challenge worth investigating the speeches detail see what lessons they can offer businesspeople who must also respond times crisis with both rhetoric and action praise the fallen advise the living both speeches are related the genre funeral orations the sense that they are the major public pronouncements date the tragic deaths thousands people from many nations the ancient greeks developed the genre its highest rhetorical state and they dictated that funeral orations have two major sections praise for the fallen and advice for the living bush begins with nice reference the state the union address order praise the fallen the normal course events presidents come this chamber report the state the union tonight such report needed has already been delivered the american people have seen the courage passengers who rushed terrorists save others the ground passengers like exceptional man named todd beamer blair dwelt more the pain and suffering the victims believe their memorial can and should greater than simply the punishment the guilty that out the shadow this evil should emerge lasting good destruction the machinery terrorism wherever found hope amongst all nations new beginning where seek resolve differences calm and ordered way greater understanding between nations and between faiths and above all justice and prosperity for the poor and dispossessed that people everywhere can see the chance better future through the hard work and creative power the free citizen not the violence and savagery the fanatic the action take will proportionate targeted will all humanly can avoid civilian casualties but understand what are dealing with listen the calls those passengers the planes think the children them told they were going die think the cruelty beyond our comprehension amongst the screams and the anguish the innocent those hijackers drove full throttle planes laden with fuel into buildings where tens thousands worked this very powerful speech making indeed but raises the question whether plays too strongly the suffering the victims part the point memorializing the fallen give meaning and perspective their lives that better done stressing the active legacy the fallen will leave behind rather than focusing their tragic deaths honest about the challenges ahead both speeches deserve high marks for not giving the politician perennial temptation overpromise how easy the future state will achieve leaders need find way affirm basic underlying hope difficult times without being pollyanna ish bush description the task ahead good example our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes americans should not expect one battle but lengthy campaign unlike any other have ever seen may include dramatic strikes visible and covert operations secret even success will starve terrorists funding turn them one against another drive them from place place until there refuge rest take announce some concrete action the speech presenters often forget the importance public speech announce new direction step taken the effect the audience powerful gives listeners sense that something even now being done that helps the healing process and gives people hope for the future blair had specific announcements his speech but his was address the labour party was different occasion and demanded different kind speech his job was lay out agenda for the party follow nonetheless bush gets the nod here for recalling that there nothing galvanizing actually making something happen speech bush took the opportunity provided announce new cabinet level position the office homeland security demonstrate leadership acting both personally and behalf the whole the requirement today for leaders both personal and corporate perhaps the toughest balancing act maintain have seen corporate leaders react crises bureaucratic undemonstrative ways that alienate the public and leave their corporate troops uninspired for example the recent tire failure debacle both ford and firestone did themselves incalculable damage putting their leaders out act mouthpieces for their corporate lawyers when real human suffering involved leaders simply must respond real human ways they also have galvanize their corporate entities respond all ways appropriate their functions today corporate leaders seem have particular difficulty handling both here bush and blair both get the balance right although different ways from the very start his speech bush shows his mastery this balancing act have seen the state our union the endurance rescuers working past exhaustion have seen the unfurling flags the lighting candles the giving blood the saying prayers english hebrew and arabic have seen the decency loving and giving people who have made the grief strangers their own fellow citizens for the last nine days the entire world has seen for itself the state our union and strong the rhetoric here achieves very delicate balance indeed between acknowledgement human suffering and the assertion the continuing strength and purposefulness the united states blair achieves similar balance coming the problem from the opposite position just two weeks ago new york after the church service met some the families the british victims was many ways very british occasion tea and biscuits was raining outside around the edge the room strangers making small talk trying normal people abnormal situation blair goes directly the grief the british families who lost loved ones but does with exquisitely chosen phrase was many ways very british occasion with that one phrase blair reminds his listeners that british values will endure despite this body blow the people close giving your audience call action the ending the single most important part presentation and all too often dealt with afterthought but the part the speech that people remember the best accordingly where you need lavish your greatest attention how well did our two speechmakers measure first president bush will not forget this wound our country those who inflicted will not yield will not rest will not relent waging this struggle for freedom and security for the american people fellow citizens meet violence with patient justice assured the rightness our cause and confident the victories come all that lies before may god grant wisdom and may watch over the united states america the call action muted but there meet violence with patient justice bush tells doesn ask and that rhetorical mistake had the call been clearer the speech would have been even stronger this phrasing tenuous enough leave the audience little unsure what supposed how are ourselves supposed deal out patient justice just waiting and blair gets higher marks for clearer call action believe this fight for freedom and want make fight for justice too this moment seize the kaleidoscope has been shaken the pieces are flux soon they will settle again before they let reorder this world around which the better speech truth both are winners bush effort more focused and less emotional remembers praise the fallen and gives muted call action bush response quite personal one has the sense confirmed press reports his closest aides that this event has transformed his presidency into one with extraordinary focus and clarity for its part blair speech has great expressivity and clear call action thus leaves the strong impression that all involved working out solution the problems created the
