been led believe when lay joined the company was already considered one houston most successful member the new york stock exchange with considerable oil and gas reserves and good political connections payne said the merger that lay engineered with much larger rival internorth saddled the newly christened enron with mountain debt through the rest the 1980s tried sell some holdings citing the need

expanding internationally that year enron announced plans for ventures europe south america and russia and later set its sights india china and other countries jumped into power plants pipelines and other deals john olson stock analyst sanders morris harris houston who was among the few who asked hard questions enron early said estimated billion global energy assets generated hopscotching around the world had yielded only sketchy returns and the former senior enron officer said the international projects were just part the hype was part the ego and the arrogance said were spread too thin there were not good controls risk evaluation dabhol and azurix among enron most glaring failures the dabhol power project india which ran into trouble before construction even started the world bank declined help india fund the plant saying was not economically viable enron poured billion into the project which was halted after change india ruling party charges flew that the deal let enron charge too much for power renegotiated the deal and construction resumed after more than year after the plant first megawatt phase started producing power its sole customer the maharashtra state electricity board accused enron charging too much and stopped paying its bills with the issue unresolved the plant stopped producing power last summer the second megawatt phase was scheduled begin operating last year but never did construction was halted june when was more than percent finished another miscalculation was ambitious overseas venture into the water and wastewater business enron bought britain wessex water for billion intending use platform sell and manage water and wastewater facilities for governments and large corporations the venture named azurix went public june but quickly ran into fierce competition from experienced multinationals rivals they outbid azurix repeatedly for projects forcing enron pay more for some deals than they were worth within six months its ipo regulators england had clamped down water rates and azurix main source cash flow dwindled sending shares down percent the company said wouldn make earnings projections and that was laying off much its staff azurix contributed sizable share the billion losses that enron announced its disastrous third quarter earnings report last year too far too fast despite such problems most wall street and the press gave enron the benefit the doubt the company kept reporting strong revenue from its core businesses natural gas and electricity and continued make bold promises sought make commodity markets out everything from pulp and paper metals the lack skepticism combined with the late 1990s internet boom boost enron next new venture trading broadband access commodity shortly after its acquisition portland general electric small oregon utility that was building fiber optic network enron announced would build its own national network that would the basis for the creation market for broadband where companies could buy and sell network time the company conceded would take years turn profit but touted broadband unit that would eventually rival natural gas trading enron spent more than billion building the business which included miles fiber optic network stacks high powered computers and network routers the market for broadband access however was too thin trade profitably and the business became heavy drain the company they tried replicate what they were good other commodity markets said andre meade analyst commerzbank securities new york who had hold rating enron stock for much they spent lot money the water business the broadband paper and pulp and metals really they tried everything once they went too far afield warning signs there were indications that enron could shaky years before its stock started its steady slide early last year john bilardello analyst with the credit rating agency standard amp poor warned that enron had too much debt hidden off balance sheet partnerships that should have been made public much that debt was tied hard assets such power plant projects being built overseas said bilardello those deals were not nearly complex the off balance sheet partnerships that precipitated the company collapse last fall but bilardello said they involved the debt problem that had never been resolved the early 1990s bilardello said amp would regularly add billion obligations and debt enron when doing their risk calculations huge amount compared other energy counterparts that figure was grow with time became more comfortable with their international strategy which included earning money building the power plants earning money from selling their output and later selling them off bilardello said but put one the lowest investment grade ratings enron and had kept that rating for more than years dropping margins enron trading business matured through the mid and late 90s and its revenues grew rapidly another troublesome trend began said arthur smith chairman and ceo the energy research firm john herold inc beginning measurement cash flow known earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda started shrink percentage the company overall revenue ebitda was percent enron revenue fell percent then percent recovered few points percent and percent and respectively but was down percent drop those margins either means you stagnant declining business which was not the case you have high cost doing business smith said appears their growth had them building expenses such rapid pace which really warning sign jim chanos president kynikos associates new york hedge fund started shorting enron stock betting that would fall november got interested after accounting professionals began questioning the way energy traders recorded some profits chanos research found that lot enron insiders were selling shares parts its financial reports were indecipherable and the company had very low rate return capital the peak their reputation for innovation this was company earning percent its capital said noting that innovators with supposedly great market position should generate threes times that amount people who looked the financials carefully were sort underwhelmed egan who downgraded enron debt rating june said found the trading operations lot less profitable than expected because those operations were falling short egan believes enron began setting its controversial partnerships signs bigger problems many those early warning signs now appear indicators what many insiders say was unique enron culture relentless pressure close deals quickly even poorly structured when the deals were closed say former executives and analysts hefty bonuses were awarded based their projected value not the real revenues brought the company the deal was projected bring percent return investment the day you signed the deal your bonus would based that said carol freedenthal principal with houston based jofree energy consulting and longtime enron watcher but when the deal came maturity and the return investment really turned out something closer percent loss there was something wrong one former enron vice president who asked remain unnamed said deals were often restructured find some way make them profitable managers did whatever took close the deals and get their bonuses even required bailing wire and chewing gum the former said enron executives may have also closed deals quickly possible for accounting reasons enron and the entire trading industry uses method called mark market accounting which essentially requires companies report front the entire value long term deal that means company would book revenue the full value year deal for electricity revenue the quarter that the contract was signed but the books are supposed adjusted the value electricity changes over time enron pays more for power than projected when the deal was signed the change has recorded loss those the industry say this isn deceptive when done correctly though critics don like the practice saying can misrepresent company current financial position several current and former enron executives say that one division the company enron energy services should have reported steep trading losses under mark market accounting rules but they say enron shifted those losses another division allowing ees appear profitable bad its core more details enron finances trickle out some now believe the complicated off balance sheet partnerships that brought wave negative press last fall were used hide postpone losses from the better established and presumably profitable business units some are starting suspect that even enron trading business was not the mature bread and butter earnings machine appeared robert mccullough portland ore based analyst who did work for the california attorney general office during that state energy crisis said there are indications that enron had artificially inflated long term electricity rates allowing report higher earnings mccullough notes that when enron filed for bankruptcy early december long term power prices dropped percent matter days that exactly what you expect they had been managing those prices mccullough said and when enron accepted the bid ubs warburg take over its energy trading business out bankruptcy this month many were surprised involved front cash makes you wonder that business was all they said was that was the best offer they could get said freedenthal were creditor want see some cash today they had new ideas wall street for the most part appears have accepted enron spin over the years for number reasons including the company sugar land police officers and fort bend county constables gater outside the sugar land home former enron vice chairman clifford baxter friday baxter was found shot death his car not far from his home authorities say was apparent suicide masterly self promotion the lucrative investment banking fees generated its many deals and its reputation for bullying those who dared questioned frankly said meade they told good story they were confident they were dynamic was exciting company listen they had new ideas think lot analysts and investors were captivated that but many including analysts and executives other energy companies still contend that enron will leave legacy innovation that changed the way natural gas and electricity are bought and sold was leader creating financial products that insured energy sellers and users against the risk falling rising prices also was the first aggressively sell utilities and other large commercial and industrial customers the means saving money outsourcing energy needs what they accomplished being factor and influence the gas and power markets that wasn smoke and mirrors said senior executive another houston energy company the executive though noted that enron influence the energy markets was far greater the past when was first out the gate that has been confirmed the speed with which other companies quickly stepped after enron collapsed absorb much its business takes time develop markets said egan the corporate credit rating agency enron wasn the party over the
