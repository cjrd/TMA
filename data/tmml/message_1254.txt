##################################################################
IAT 2011 provides a leading international forum to bring together researchers and practitioners from diverse fields, such as computer science, information technology, business, education, systems engineering, and robotics, to (1) examine the design principles and performance characteristics of various approaches in intelligent agent technology, and (2) increase the cross-fertilization of ideas on the development of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems among different domains. By encouraging idea-sharing and discussions on the underlying logical, cognitive, physical, and sociological foundations as well as the enabling technologies of intelligent agents, IAT 2011 will foster the development of novel paradigms and advanced solutions in agent and multi-agent based computing.
IAT 2011 will be jointly held with the 2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI 2011).
The two conferences will have a joint opening, keynotes, reception, and banquet.
WI-IAT 2011 will include a summer school providing in-depth background on subjects that are of broad interest to Web intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology communities. It will also include workshops and an industry day. The workshop and the industry day programs will focus on new research challenges, initiatives and applications.
All papers accepted for workshops and industry day will be included in the Workshop and industry day Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press and will be available on site.

On-Line Submissions and Publication
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
High-quality papers in all IAT related areas are solicited.
Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of 8 pages in the IEEE 2-column format.
The same format will be used for final camera-ready papers (see the Author Guidelines at http://www.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting)
All submitted papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity.
Note that IAT 2011 will accept ONLY on-line submissions in PDF format. Please use the Submission Form on the WI-IAT 2011 website to submit your paper. Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society Press that is indexed by EI.
Submissions accepted as regular papers will be allocated 8 pages in the proceedings and accorded oral presentation times in the main conference.
Submissions accepted as short papers will be allocated 4 pages in the proceedings and will have a shorter presentation time at
the conference than regular papers.
All co-authors will be notified at all time, for the submission, notification, and confirmation on the attendance. Submitting a paper to the conference and workshops means that, if the paper is accepted, at least one author should attend the conference to present the paper. The acceptance list and no-show list will be openly published on-line. For no-show authors, their affiliations will receive a notification.
Authors of a selected number of IAT 2011 accepted papers will be invited to submit extended and revised versions of their papers for condideration for inclusion in Web Intelligence and Agent Systems: An International Journal (http://wi-consortium.org/journal.html) and other related journals.
The best paper awards will be conferred at the conference on the authors of (1) the best research paper and (2) the best application paper. Application-oriented submissions will be considered for the best application paper award.
More detailed instructions and the On-Line Submission Form will be found on the IAT 2011 homepage:
http://wi-iat-2011.org
