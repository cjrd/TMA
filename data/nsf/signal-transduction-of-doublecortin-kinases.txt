              microtubule (MT)-based-cytoskeleton.  Doublecortin (DCX) is a novel microtubule
              associated protein  (MAP) and is the major gene mutated in X-Lissencephaly and
              Subcortical Band Heterotopia (X-LIS /SCLH), a severe disorder in neuronal
              migration during development of the cerebral cortex.  Doublecortin kinase 2
              (DCK2) is a chimeric protein with a domain highly related to that of DCX fused
              to a protein kinase domain related to calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. 
              The goal of this project is to investigate the functional effects and role of
              phosphorylation in the interaction of DCK2 with the MT-cytoskeleton, and to
              test the hypothesis that cellular events such as the establishment of neuronal
              polarity and neuronal process extension may be dependent upon rapid modulation
              of MT dynamics due to reversible signaling to and from members of the DCX/DCK
              family of proteins.
