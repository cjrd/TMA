              
In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Sanov will combine  femtosecond spectroscopy with
              photoelectron imaging to monitor the evolution of molecular orbitals in the
              course of chemical reactions. The initial systems to be studied include
              isolated and hydrated sulfur-containing molecular anions, and cluster anions.
              These are chosen for their practical importance and for serving as prototypes
              for the development of the new methodology. Photodissociation and unimolecular
              decomposition, dynamics at conical intersections, microscopic solvation, wave
              packet evolution, and  bimolecular reactions in ionic clusters will be
              investigated.  The results of this research will find immediate application in
              modeling the structure and dynamics of negative ions and solutions. 

Many
              important chemical processes involve ionic reactions, and the reactivity is
              affected strongly by interactions with the environment.  In this research
              cluster ions are used as model micro-solutions for the studies of elementary
              processes relevant to biological and environmental chemistry. The results will
              provide insight into how the intermolecular interactions affect the behavior of
              electrons and chemical bonding. Photoelectron imaging experiments will be
              incorporated in the undergraduate Physical Chemistry program as a way of
              providing the students with hands-on research experience.  A fast-track
              Internet-based mechanism for publishing the results of student research will be
              developed. Students will be trained in research techniques in preparation for
              advanced studies and for entry into the scientific/technical workforce.
