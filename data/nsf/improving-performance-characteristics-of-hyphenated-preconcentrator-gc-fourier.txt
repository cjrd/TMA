              Professor Touradj Solouki of the University of Maine at Orono (UMO) is supported
              by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to investigate cryofocusing of
              analytes in an Electrospray Ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron
              Resonance (ESI-FT-ICR) mass spectrometer.  To overcome sensitivity problems of
              FT-ICR, Professor Solouki has added a pre-concentration (PC) gas chromatograph
              (GC) step to his setup.  The goal of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research
              is to add an additional device:  a cryofocuser after the GC.  This is predicted
              to improve the detection limit by two orders of magnitude, and mass resolving
              power by a factor of 5-10.  The PI will then identify biomarkers for sensor
              development and establish a "gold standard" to evaluate analytical performance
              of sensor devices. Undergraduate and graduate students participate in the
              research.

Mass spectrometry is being developed as an almost "universal
              detector" and has been utilized to detect trace amounts of substances such as
              chemical and biological weapons.  The instrument being developed in this
              research, while not fieldable as a sensor directly due to size and cost, can
              aid in the development of low cost, accurate sensors.   It is thus of interest
              in national security, as well as a host of other medical and environmental
              applications.
