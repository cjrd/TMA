Ecological
              processes and genetic variation are increasingly being integrated in
              coevolutionary models of plant-pathogen interactions, yet little progress has
              been made in relating this theoretical work to natural systems. This research
              will characterize the dynamics of the interaction between the bacterial
              pathogen Pseudomonas viridiflava and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana by
              combining experimental and observational data with an evolutionary model. This
              will be one of only a few studies of natural plant-pathogen interactions and
              the first to study the dynamics of a bacterial pathogen in a wild plant
              population. A. thaliana has been a highly productive model system for studying
              plant resistance to pathogen infection in the laboratory and a growing amount
              of molecular evolutionary data is available for genes in A.thaliana that confer
              resistance to bacterial pathogens. By placing disease resistance in A. thaliana
              in an ecological and evolutionary context, this study will contribute to a
              greater understanding of recent molecular genetic results. A more complete
              understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of resistance in plant populations
              and virulence in pathogen populations, through studies such as this one, will
              be a necessary step towards the achievement of durable disease resistance in
              agricultural crops.
