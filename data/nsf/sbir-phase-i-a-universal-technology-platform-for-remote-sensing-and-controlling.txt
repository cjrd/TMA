              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at the
              development of a universal technology platform for remote sensing and
              controlling.  This technology development will be carried out with a focus on
              affordability, ease of use, reliability, usage of and compatibility with
              existing communication standards, computer platform independence,
              modularity/reconfigurability, scalability and expandability.  One commercial
              application using this Internet-based technology will foster the enhancement of
              education through remotely accessible experimental devices, the availability of
              which will provide significant relief to the strain on the spatial, temporal
              and fiscal resources that traditional laboratories impose on educational
              institutions.  The initial beneficiaries of the proposed technology will be
              students at the undergraduate and graduate college levels.  Subsequently, the
              propagation of the technology into the K-12, corporate training, and scientific
              experimentation arenas as well as into industrial and consumer applications
              appears to be both feasible and plausible.

The enabling of remote access to
              various experimental devices proffered by JDS Technologies will facilitate
              improved student learning of scientific and technical principles.  The proposed
              technology will promote independent and asynchronous learning patterns.  It
              will also permit experimental demonstrations in lectures and allow
              experimentation to be included in distance learning programs.  It thus provides
              access to sophisticated and cost intensive experimentation for a much larger
              student audience than would be possible in the absence of the remote-access
              capabilities.
