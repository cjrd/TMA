              This research is devoted to problems in mathematical analysis
arising from
              questions in physics. There are six main areas: (1)
The ultraviolet problem in
              quantum electrodynamics, (2) analysis of the
precise rate of approach to
              equilibrium on models of Kac type for kinetic 
theory, (3) problems of
              interface motion arising from phase separation problems 
in non-equilibrium
              statistical mechanics, (4) sharp Lieb-Thirring 
inequalities, and (5) the
              search for patterns in minimizers of simple energy 
functionals. Our proposed
              research into these various problems in
each case centers on a strategy in
              which geometric and dynamical analysis 
of problems in the calculus of
              variations
plays a key role. We expect, as in our past research, that this
              strategy will
lead us to discover new results and methods in pure analysis, as
              well as to
improve the understanding of the physical phenomena in
              question.


This research is devoted to problems in mathematical
              analysis
arising from questions in physics. There are five main research
              areas
concerning a range of problems from mathematically rigorous 
quantum
              electrodynamics to hydrodynamics. Our
proposed strategies for researching 
              these topics in
each case centers on a  geometric and dynamical analysis
of
              problems in the calculus of variations.
We expect, as in our past research,
              that this strategy will
lead us to discover useful new results and methods in
              pure mathematical 
analysis, as well as to
improve the understanding of the
              physical phenomena in question.
