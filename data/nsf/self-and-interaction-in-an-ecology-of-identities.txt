              Research shows that people usually act to maintain their image of themselves in
              social identities that they occupy- identities like father or son, boss or
              employee, friend or adversary.  Current theories of identity assume that people
              only see themselves in one identity in each social situation, and that their
              behavior is guided by attempts to support that identity.  Recently, the PIs
              have begun to consider more complex situations where people see themselves in
              two or more identities at the same time.  For example, a policeman who stops a
              speeder who turns out to be his uncle is in a situation where he is
              simultaneously a law enforcement officer and a nephew.  In this research the
              investigators will extend their research to examine what kinds of social
              systems make people more or less likely to have many identities.  They will
              develop a theory to answer this question using computer simulations and
              principles about how groups and networks are related in social systems.   They
              also investigate what kinds of situations lead people to enact more than one
              identity at a time, and how these situations affect how they feel.   A data set
              that samples the situations in which University of Arizona students, faculty
              and staff found themselves will be used to test predictions that
              multiple-identity occupancy causes stress and the experience of mixed emotions.
