We propose
              to study the topology of the union of a finite collection of boxes that covers
              an
intersection curve in the plane and in 3D space. The representation of
              curves that are the
result of surface intersections is nearly never exact, and
              thus certain approximations schemes are
employed. The result is often a
              piecewise linear approximation cl, which lies within a certain
neighborhood N,
              of the actual curve c. Much of the research in this area has been focused
              on
the approximation cl of c and how c and cl are/are not similar. We propose
              to develop suficient
conditions on the collection of the boxes and the
              intersection curve, so that the resulting union
of the collection is a
              topological manifold homotopically equivalent to the given curve. In the
case
              where the curve has no self-intersections, this collection can serve as another
              means of
representing the curve, and thus this new representation can be used
              in a variety of engineering
applications. We believe this to be an innovative
              exploratory study appropriate for SGER
funding.
