              The objective of the proposed research is to improve network security through an
              innovative approach to vulnerability and resiliency analysis. Even well
              administered networks are vulnerable to attacks due to the security
              ramifications of offering a variety of combined services. That is, services
              that are secure when offered in isolation nonetheless provide an attacker with
              combined vulnerabilities to exploit when offered simultaneously.  Security
              tools such as COPS, System Scanner, and CyberCop, are excellent at identifying
              specific, known, individual host vulnerabilities in services, software
              packages, and configurations. What these methods do not address is the compound
              effect of multiple vulnerabilities.  The result is a serious problem because
              interactions between vulnerabilities can easily cascade across a network.  The
              risk posed by each vulnerability may be judged either necessary or acceptable
              in isolation, but the combination of these vulnerabilities can still turn out
              to compromise the network as a whole in an unacceptable way. A limited amount
              of existing work in vulnerability analysis addresses this problem, but the
              existing work falls short in three key areas, namely resiliency analysis,
              all-paths analysis, and inference engine analysis.  The proposed work will
              improve network security by addressing systematically each of these three
              areas.
