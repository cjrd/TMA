              A conjecture of Serre predicts that certain 2-dimensional mod p
representations
              of Galois groups over Q arise from modular forms,
and it further predicts the
              level and weight of the form.
The principal investigator and his collaborators
              are investigating
a possible generalization of Serre's conjecture to the
              context
of Hilbert modular forms and Galois groups over totally real fields.
              
The prediction of the weights suggests interesting new phenomena, and
the
              immediate aims of the research are to investigate these phenomena
and provide
              numerical evidence for the generalization.

Serre's conjecture and its
              generalizations can be viewed as part of
Langlands' program, which predicts a
              deep correspondence between objects from
algebraic geometry (solution sets of
              polynomial equations, such as elliptic
curves) and objects from representation
              theory (functions with symmetry
properties, such as modular forms).  While
              there has been significant
recent progress (for example, the investigator and
              collaborators,
building on Wiles' work on Fermat's Last Theorem, proved that
              all
rational elliptic curves arise from modular forms), Langlands'
program
              remains largely conjectural.  The links it provides between
two seemingly
              different branches of mathematics reveal properties 
of the integers, which
              can, in turn, have applications to cryptography.
