Modeling the Social and Technical
              Processes of Interorganizational Information Integration

This grant will
              develop and test dynamic models of information integration in
              multi-organizational government settings.  Three questions will be addressed:
              1) What are the critical factors and processes involved in integrating
              information across levels and agencies in government? 2) How do the factors and
              processes vary for different types and degrees of integration? and 3) Can the
              process of integration be modeled in ways that improve understanding of
              information system development and of inter-organizational  collaboration? Two
              policy areas in particular will be featured; law enforcement and environmental
              protection. Both areas include a full range of functions across
              Federal-State-Local levels of government and both areas have efforts underway
              to bridge those levels. The project will combine perspectives from
              organizational behavior, computer and information science, and political
              science, and will use system dynamics modeling and social processes modeling.
