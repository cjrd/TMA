"Towards Predictability and Portability in
              Embedded Software"

This project develops, implements, and validates
              platform-independent programming models for embedded software with hard
              real-time constraints.  For high-performance control applications, the
              time-triggered programming language Giotto is implemented by targeting the
              Embedded Machine.  The Embedded Machine is a virtual machine that mediates in
              real time the interaction between software processes and physical environment
              processes.  The Embedded Machine is ported to single-CPU and distributed
              platforms.
Embedded Machine code is validated by schedulability analysis.
