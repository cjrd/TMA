This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) of
              the National Science Foundation (NSF), provides support for a workshop designed
              to explore the future aerogeophysical needs of the Antarctic community. A new
              airborne geophysical facility needs to be developed for the Antarctic Program
              so that key scientific questions, ranging from crustal structure and tectonics
              to ice sheet structure and glacial dynamics, can be addressed in all regions of
              Antarctica. Interest from the scientific community to study remote areas of
              East and West Antarctica as well as look in detail at areas around exposed
              rocks require consideration of airborne platforms such as long-range aircraft
              (C-130's, P-3) or helicopters in addition to the Twin Otter. New
              instrumentation, such as swath-mapping systems for high-resolution (1 m)
              airborne mapping of topography and imaging spectometers (AVIRIS), has recently
              been developed. The loss of the SOAR facility leaves the U.S. Antarctic program
              without a means to remotely map sub-ice geology as well as ice sheet
              characteristics, thus limiting the ability to address fundamental questions in
              Antarctic geology and glaciology. A workshop tying the NSF Antarctic program
              goals and science targets identified in previous workshops to the development
              of new airborne geophysics capabilities could result in a focused program to
              combine broad science goals with the appropriate airborne
geophysical tools
              and platforms. This award will support a workshop that will help define the
              type of airborne geophysical facility (instruments and platforms) most useful
              for the Antarctic
Earth Science and Glaciology communities to use to address
              important science issues in key target areas.
