              The goal of this project is to develop novel interprocedural techniques for
              compiling scientific and engineering applications on distributed address space
              parallel machines.  With recent advances in parallel and supercomputing
              architectures, the application programmers have unprecedented computational
              power available. However, it has also become increasingly difficult to harness
              this power.  The parallelizing and  optimizing compilers usually turn out to be
              inadequate, since they restrict the analysis to a single procedure level.
              However, by developing a set of novel effective and efficient interprocedural
              techniques, the efficacy of the parallel compilers can be enhanced
              significantly, without significallty slowing the compilation process.  In
              message passing machines and distributed shares memory machines, the
              compilation process involves several complex tasks, including data
              distribution, locality management, placement of communication and/or
              synchronization, and aggregating remote memory accesses.  This project will
              develop new interprocedural techniques for performing these phases of analysis
              interprocedurally.
