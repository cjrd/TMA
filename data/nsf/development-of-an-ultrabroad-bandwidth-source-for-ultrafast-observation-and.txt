              This award from the Major Research Instrumentation will support instrument
              development at the University of Florida. A group of physicists and chemists
              with a common need for broadband spectroscopic probing of materials with
              ultrafast time resolution have teamed together to develop a high brightness,
              high repetition rate femtosecond laser chirped pulse amplifier system capable
              of providing high intensity pulses over a range of wavelengths spanning 3
              decades from 200 nm to 20 microns.  Pulses with temporal duration approaching
              10 femtoseconds and intensities nearing 100 Petawatts per square centimeter
              will be delivered at a repetition rate of 10 Kilohertz.  In addition, the
              instrument will have the capability to 'sculpt' temporal pulse shapes to
              produce 'pulse shapes on demand'. Applications will include investigations of
              ultrafast chemical reactions in dendrimers, studies of nonlinear optical
              properties of carbon nanotubes, investigations of protein folding, and coherent
              control of solid state phase transitions and molecular motion. The instrument
              will be operated by a campus wide shared facility serving cross disciplinary
              training ground for future scientists with programs in the application of
              ultrafast optical techniques to problems in physics, chemistry, biology and
              materials. It will allso be part of a teaching activity for undergraduate
              studenbts in science  and engineering through established NSF-funded summer REU
              programs.
