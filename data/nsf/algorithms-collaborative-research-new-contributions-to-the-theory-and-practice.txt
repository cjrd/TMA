              operations, there are natal extensions that impact sparse direct methods. It is
              the goal of the proposed project to pursue a unified approach to all of these
              insights in an effort to put software architectures of linear algebra libraries
              for this domain of operations on a solid scientific footing.  We will undertake
              a one year pilot project that will demonstrate the following: (1) The
              systematic approach can be used to derive highly efficient kernels for
              specialized dense linear algebra operations that are encountered in sparse
              direct methods; (2) The abstract program interface that has been demonstrated
              to allow high-performance implementation of dense linear algebra operations
              will be extended to apply to sparse matrices that are viewed as hierarchical
              matrices; (3) We will lay the foundation for a mathematical description of
              sparse matrices as hierarchical matrices which we believe will allow the
              derivation methods to be extended to operations on hierarchical matrices.
