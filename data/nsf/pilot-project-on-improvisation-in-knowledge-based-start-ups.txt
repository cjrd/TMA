              This pilot project proposes to interview principals in young knowledge-based
              firms in the Madison, Wisconsin area. Half will be firms that depend on
              university-generated science, typically involving faculty members. Data will be
              gathered to generate new inductive insights into how and when these firms use
              improvisation (in contrast to more traditional action modes of planning
              followed by execution, or following organizational routines) as an action mode
              in key behavior. Data will also be used to assess feasibility and develop
              measures to assess (1) setback incidents; (2) whether and when a firm switches
              to or from an improvisational action mode; (3) changes in the firm's network of
              key advisors; (4) other theory and control variables. The feasibility and
              measurement work will lay the groundwork for the design of a systematic study
              of related formal hypotheses. The pilot project is part of a long-term project
              to increase understanding of how improvisation can either help or hurt the
              prosperity of knowledge-based start-ups, and how key advisors moderate these
              processes.
Contemporary entrepreneurship correctly emphasizes planning skills,
              which are essential. However, there is also some evidence that improvisation
              can represent a valuable organizational competency, especially for firms in
              high risk, high tech settings. Understanding and codifying knowledge about
              improvisation will encourage the development of theory as well as more
              sophisticated curriculum development in the area of entrepreneurship.
