              This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science
              and Engineering" (NSF 00-119). The goal of this project is to develop laser and
              optoelectronic device technologies that achieve photon and electron confinement
              to generate 0-dimensional states, based on advances in nanolithography and dry
              etching to fabricate nanocrystals containing self-organized quantum dots. A
              decrease of a semiconductor laser's volume to its minimum size, while
              maintaining high Q, along with a decrease in the electronic confinement
              potential, may result in revolutionary advances in device operation.  These
              include high-speed operation below and at threshold, and high efficiency in the
              spontaneous regime below threshold. In the ultimate limits of small active
              volume and sufficiently high Q the system can enter the quantum reversible
              regime necessary to create quantum-entangled states. Both these quantum limits
              of the photons and electron-hole pairs are possible using III-V nanostructured
              active material and nanostructured photonic crystals. The materials to be
              employed in these studies will be GaAs/AlGaAs/InGaAs strained layer
              heterostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy, which will be fabricated into
              photonic crystal lasers and microcavities. The III-V heterostructures will be
              grown at the University of Texas/Austin Microelectronics Research Center, and
              photonic crystal fabrication will take place at the California Institute of
              Technology(CIT) and at UT-Austin. The III-V nanostructures will be optimized
              for high-speed operation based on studies to be carried out at CIT.
              Manufacturable processes for the nanolithography will be developed at
              UT-Austin. Graduate research assistants working towards Ph.D. degrees represent
              a major component of this research. The expected impact of the research is the
              development of a new technology for low power, high speed optoelectronic
              interconnects suitable for wavelength division multiplexing and low power
              transceivers for optical interconnects, and new devices useful for exchange of
              quantum information.

The project addresses basic materials science and
              engineering research issues in a topical area of materials science with high
              technological relevance. An important feature of the program is the integration
              of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally
              and technologically significant area. The project will develop strong
              technical, communication, and organizational/management skills in students
              through unique educational experiences made possible by a collaborative
              forefront research environment. The project is co-supported by the DMR/EM,
              ECS/PFET, and EEC Divisions.
