              OpenGeneX will provide a toolkit of capabilities for gene expression data
              management and analysis in an extensible system.  The work will focus on core
              capabilities, such as addition of links to the database schema and an
              object-layer application programming interface and a data upload tool for
              automated loading into the database.  In order to support uniform, efficient
              data analysis, a framework for incorporating new methods and defining protocols
              will be developed.  The analysis protocol manager will be designed to permit
              storing and tracking of analysis procedures and validated and tested in a
              community-wide effort.  A variety of analysis tools, including data
              preprocessing and normalization as well as statistical validation clustering
              methods will be developed. A prototype of peer-to-peer database connectivity
              will be created to test for supporting diverse gene expression resources in a
              cost-effective manner.  The project is open source, so that other freely
              available software can be incorporated, rather than redesigned.
