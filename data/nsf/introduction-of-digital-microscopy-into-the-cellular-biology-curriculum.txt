              Biological Sciences (61)
In this project we are taking advantage of recent
              advances in video and computer technology to improve student experiences in our
              undergraduate Biology curriculum. We are introducing four digital microscopy
              workstations into our cell biology, microbiology, and plant physiology courses.
              These workstations permit us to offer laboratory exercises that expose students
              to techniques and phenomena normally confined to the research laboratory. We
              are adapting research techniques from the contemporary science literature and
              building upon the efforts of several other project supported by NSF that
              incorporate digital microscopy workstations into the undergraduate curriculum
              (e.g., DUE-0088185, 9952672 and 0088412). For example, phase and fluorescence
              microscopy is being used in experiments to examine the various cell
              compartments and dynamic processes such as organelle transport and cell
              migration. Students have the capability to make digital records, including
              time-lapse movies, of their phase and fluorescence observations. It is our
              experience that experiments that include fluorescence and video microscopy
              generate the greatest excitement among our students.
