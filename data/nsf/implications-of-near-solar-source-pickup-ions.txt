              The investigators will study major heliospheric pickup ion sources in the solar
              wind, their propagation and acceleration.  Pickup ions are generated from
              neutral atoms when they become ionized and begin to gyrate in a plasma's
              magnetic field.  In the case of the solar wind, pickup ions born from slowly
              moving neutrals acquire an initial speed nearly equal to the solar wind speed
              as they are transported out with the solar wind's magnetic field.  The pickup
              process thereby creates a more energetic and therefore more easily observed
              population of ions that may be used to infer properties of the neutral
              environment from which they were created.  In the heliosphere, there are three
              main populations of pickup ions: interstellar pickup ions from interstellar
              neutrals, inner source pickup ions created by interactions between
              interplanetary dust and the solar wind, and discrete source pickup ions from
              comets, planets, and other discrete sources.  The investigators will
              characterize near-solar pickup ion sources by modeling distribution functions
              and hydrodynamic properties of pickup ions produced from near-solar and
              interstellar sources.  They will also study the relative significance of
              near-solar source pickup ions, interstellar source pickup ions, and solar wind
              particles as seed populations for energetic particles and anomalous cosmic
              rays.
