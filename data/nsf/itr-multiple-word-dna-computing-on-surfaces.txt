TITLE: ITR:
              Multiple-Word DNA Computing on Surfaces


This effort will extend the scope
              and power of surface-based DNA computing in two major respects:  i) by scale-up
              of the size of problem addressed experimentally, ii) by increasing
              computational generality by extending capabilities to the solution of
              circuit-SAT problems.

Goal (i) will be scaling up the computing process
              using a problem size of 24 bits as a target goal.  24 bits corresponds to a
              solution space size of 1.7 x 107 elements, a factor of ten million increase
              over the 4 bit problem addressed previously.

Goal (ii) - For a computing
              model to be general, that is, capable of efficiently simulating algorithms used
              in conventional electronic computing, it must be able to efficiently simulate
              circuits.  The ability to simulate Boolean formulas is not sufficient.  In
              theoretical work, it is shown that the surface-based approach, when using
              multiple words and the MARK, DESTROY-UNMARKED, UNMARK, and APPEND operations,
              is such a generalizable approach to computing, but it has not been implemented
              experimentally.  This proposal seeks to implement this approach experimentally
              and to apply it to the solution of circuit-SAT problems.
