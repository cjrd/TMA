              Abstract:

Wenzl is continuing his study of tensor categories related to
              quantum
groups and conformal field theory, with a particular emphasis on
              their
connection with subfactors. Braided tensor categories related
              to
classical Lie groups can be conveniently studied via Hecke algebras
and
              q-versions of Brauer algebras, also called BMW algebras. Wenzl
plans to study
              the question whether  categories related to exceptional 
Lie groups can
              similarly be described via suitable braid representations.
Moreover, a
              detailed knowledge of such braid representations, combined
with additional
              categorical constructions, such as the double construction,
might also be
              useful for understanding various exotic subfactors.


Physical systems
              usually have symmetries which can be  expressed via
groups and their
              representations. In recent years, one has encountered
new situations in
              confomal field theory with a highly nontrivial
tensor product operation called
              fusion. Unlike the group case, it is
no longer symmetric, but only braided.
              Moreover, the numbers which 
naturally occur as 'dimensions' of
              representations of the symmetries are 
no longer integers. This is a situation
              very familiar in the theory of
von Neumann algebras. Wenzl plans to study the
              above mentioned symmetries
in the context of von Neumann algebras. He will
              mainly consider algebras
generated by unitary representations of braid groups.
              Such representations
are comparatively rare, and hence provide a good tool for
              classifying
models of the type mentioned above.
