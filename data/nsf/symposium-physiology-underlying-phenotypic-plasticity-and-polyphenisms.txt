              The final form of many animals (perhaps most animals) depends on the environment
              in which they develop. This symposium will be a series of talks by both faculty
              and graduate students on how animals regulate modifications in their
              development in response to environmental changes. Hence, it explores internal
              controls of the "nurture" end of the nature-vs.-nurture dichotomy. For example,
              the eggs of some turtles develop into males if incubated at cool temperatures
              but develop into females if incubated at warm temperatures. Many such
              environmental effects on animal development are known, but the hormonal
              processes involved in regulating these developmental switches are less well
              known. For example, in turtle eggs, what are the cellular processes underlying
              the temperature effect on sex hormones and sex determination? The talks in this
              symposium will present results on environmentally affected developmental
              processes in animals. Included will be lectures on how toads either undergo
              metamorphosis to a small adult or grow to a larger larvae, how beetles grow
              either large or small horns, and how butterflies develop wings with either
              large or small eyespots. Perhaps most important, there has never been a
              conference on environmental effects on development that brings together
              biologists who study a wide range of animals. This cross-disciplinary
              discussion could lead to new advances in understanding how animals control
              developmental responses to the environment.
