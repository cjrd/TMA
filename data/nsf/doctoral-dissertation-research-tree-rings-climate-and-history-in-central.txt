              This research will use new tree-ring chronologies from Mexico in conjunction
              with historical records to reconstruct the history of extreme drought/wetness
              events and examine their impact on the environment and society in central
              Mexico for the last 300 to 500 years. Initial analyses of recently developed
              tree-ring chronologies from central Mexico indicate that tree growth there is
              strongly influenced by extreme climatic events such as drought. Several periods
              of abnormally poor growth apparent in the tree-ring record are coincident with
              drought-induced crop failures, famine, and attendant social disruption in
              central Mexico. The primary objective of this project will be to develop the
              first robust tree-ring reconstructions of precipitation in central Mexico, and
              use this data to validate and quantify historical records of extreme climate
              and related socio-environmental impacts. A variety of primary and secondary
              historical records will be consulted, including records from the Archivo
              General de la Nacion in Mexico City. Another objective of this project will be
              to reconstruct the timing of monsoon onset in central-southern Mexico and
              examine the consequences of abnormally early or late monsoon seasons. The
              timing and seasonal distribution of rainfall is an important factor in crop
              production in central Mexico, and several of our new tree-ring chronologies are
              well correlated with the onset date of the North American Monsoon System. The
              precipitation reconstructions will be developed using transfer functions
              between individual and regionally averaged tree-ring chronologies from central
              Mexico and precipitation data at both local and regional scales. The
              reconstruction of monsoon onset date will utilize the complete network of
              tree-ring chronologies in Mexico to derive the best relationship between the
              tree-ring record and onset date. Monsoon onset date will be determined using
              threshold analysis of daily precipitation data.

Central Mexico is one of the
              most populous regions on earth. Reconstructions of past climate using
              tree-rings and other environmental data indicate that northern Mexico and the
              southwestern United States have experienced extreme climate fluctuations over
              the past 500 to 1000 years. There is an extensive body of historical
              documentation regarding the impact of climate on agriculture and society in
              central Mexico. But long, climate-sensitive tree-ring records have previously
              not been available for this region. The tree-ring reconstructions of
              precipitation and monsoon onset will represent new environmental records for
              the study of past climate and its impact on ecosystems and society in Mexico.
              The results of this research will be disseminated through conference
              presentations and journals, and by contribution to the International Tree-Ring
              Data Bank at the National Geophysical Data Center.  As a Doctoral Dissertation
              Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a
              promising student to establish a strong independent research career.
