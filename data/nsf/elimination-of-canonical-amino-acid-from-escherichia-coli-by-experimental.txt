              acids is hypothesized to have gradually increased from a few to the twenty that
              now constitute the building-blocks of proteins in living cells. The objective
              of this research is to recreate a possible evolutionary intermediate in which a
              living organism contains 19 and not 20 amino acids. This objective would give
              insight into how protein structures adapt to mutation and open possibilities in
              terms of designing and selecting organisms adapted to a different chemical
              composition.   Based on encouraging results from recent experiments, this
              objective will be accomplished by placing a population under selective pressure
              for the loss of a given amino acid. Two different strategies have been designed
              to replace isoleucine by valine and threonine by serine in Escherichia coli.
              These strategies combine selection strategies that exploit classical strain
              constructions with the use of a continuous culture apparatus that allows
              long-term experiments.
