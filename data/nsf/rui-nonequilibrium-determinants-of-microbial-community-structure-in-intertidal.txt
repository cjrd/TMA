Bacteria serve dual roles in sedimentary systems: as
              decomposers of organic detritus and as food for higher organisms.  Key
              ecological parameters such as abundance, production, and community composition
              each contribute to the character of these roles.  The primary objectives of the
              research proposed here are to determine the mechanisms by which bacterial
              assemblages recover from ingestion by sediment-feeding invertebrates (deposit
              feeders), and to assess the importance of this biological disturbance to the
              structure of sedimentary bacterial communities.  We will determine the
              significance of nonequilibrium factors in creating spatio-temporal
              heterogeneity and maintaining diversity in microbial communities exposed to
              deposit feeding in particular, and disturbances in general.  We hope to reveal
              those important variables required to construct and test patch dynamics models,
              thereby providing a basis for predictions regarding the community structure and
              metabolic activities of indigenous and introduced bacteria in sediments.
