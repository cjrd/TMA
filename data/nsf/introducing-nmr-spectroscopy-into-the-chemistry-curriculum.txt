With the upgrade of our Varian continuous wave 60 MHz NMR
              spectrometer to an efficient multinuclear FT-NMR spectrometer equipped with 2-D
              capabilities using technology developed by Anasazi Inc., we are incorporating
              modern NMR techniques across our chemistry laboratory curriculum at Florida
              Institute of Technology. We introduce routine Proton and Carbon-13 analyses
              into lower division labs, reinforcing identification techniques taught in the
              lecture. More sophisticated experiments such as 2D and multinuclear analyses,
              kinetics and equilibrium studies of reactions, Quantum Mechanics applied to NMR
              analysis, and Dynamic NMR Spectroscopy are being adapted into upper division
              labs. Most of the experiments are taken form the chemical education literature
              such as the J. Chem. Educ. We anticipate the progressive integration of the
              experiments into our curriculum to continue. We are also using this instrument
              in ongoing undergraduate research projects. Students independently run samples
              using the upgraded FT-NMR instrument without any operational difficulties and
              the hardware/software operation is durable and reliable enough that requires
              only moderate supervision during student usage. We are involving the Science
              Education Department at Florida Tech in the evaluation of the project and plan
              to present the results of this project at regional and national professional
              meetings. In addition, we will submit articles describing any new NMR
              experiment and/or resulting curriculum improvement to the Journal of Chem.
