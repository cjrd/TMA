Title:  Student/Faculty Mentor Teams for SIAM
              Symposium on Computational Models and Simulation 

This project supports
              teams of mentors and students to participate in the SIAM Symposium on
              Computational Models and Simulation for Intra-Cellular Processes to be held in
              Washington, DC, October 4-5, 2002. The project provides access to a high
              quality technical symposium encouraging a new generation of students to come
              together with key researchers in the filed, hear research presentation and
              discuss both technical and community building topics. Developments in High
              Performance Computing and communications technologies have advanced quickly
              allowing its tools of visualization and simulation to become new research tools
              in advancing knowledge in areas where researchers were not traditionally major
              users of high performance computing such as the soft science of biology. HPC is
              now becoming a modality for major advances in both systems and intracellular
              biological processes. Advances are needed in mathematical and statistical
              methods to impact the prediction of spatio-temporal cellular behavior. The
              areas require further development in high speed data mining and data analysis
              techniques, knowledge acquisition tools, new information architectures,
              scalable computing, collaborative technologies, simulations methods and
              geometric software promoting and enhancing visualization as a research tool.
              The project contributes to stimulate students in these areas.
