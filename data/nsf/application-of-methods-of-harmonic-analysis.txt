	Fefferman and Stein will study problems in harmonic
              analysis, including 
the decay of multilinear-operator-valued oscillatory
              integrals, the domination of pseudodifferential operators, ergodic theory on
              semisimple Lie groups, multi-parameter harmonic analysis and its applications
              to several complex variables, constructive methods in fluid mechanics, discrete
              versions of singular Radon transforms, scaling laws for mechanical systems, and
              applications of harmonic analysis to atoms.

	Harmonic analysis began with
              the work of Fourier in the early 19th century.  Its theme is to analyze complex
              behavior (heat flow, vibration,...) by writing it as a sum of basic pieces
              behaving in the simplest way.  Harmonic analysis is crucial in many parts of
              science and technology.  Fefferman and Stein are pursuing ideas in harmonic
              analysis and relating them to problems in mathematics and physics.
