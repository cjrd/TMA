              Ecologists often rely on computer-intensive Monte Carlo simulations to quantify
              patterns of population and community structure. These models are called null
              models, because they are null with respect to a certain process, such as
              interspecific competition. EcoSim is a Windows-based interactive simulation
              software application that allows for a variety of null model analyses. The
              program currently contains modules for the analysis of species diversity,
              species co-occurrence, niche overlap, body size overlap, and macroecology. The
              current proposal will allow for the development of new EcoSim modules for the
              analysis of spatial and temporal patterns at the population and community
              level. Community modules include tests of concordance, spatial co-occurrence,
              biogeographic overlap, and Markovian succession.  Population modules include
              analyses of density-dependence, population viability, spatial pattern, and
              distance covariance.  EcoSim is widely used by the academic and educational
              community, as both a research and a teaching tool. It frees researchers and
              educators from the time-consuming chores of programming, testing, and debugging
              ecologically relevant programs.  The program contains extensive documentation,
              sample data sets, a tutorial, and an html-based help system. The program is
              available at no cost to the public and scientific community from the EcoSim
              website.
