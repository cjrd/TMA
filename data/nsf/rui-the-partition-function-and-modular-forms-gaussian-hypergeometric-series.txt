              This award will support the investigator's ongoing research in the field of
              number theory.  For example, the investigator will continue his study of the
              interplay between  the theory of modular forms and partition theory.  He will
              also  study  the "Gaussian hypergeometric series'' and their relationships to
              elliptic curves, modular forms, p-adic analysis, arithmetic geometry, and
              combinatorics.  In addition, the award will  enable the investigator to expand
              his efforts in undergraduate education and research.

Number Theory is a very
              old branch of mathematics which has its roots in the study of the whole
              numbers.  In modern times it has become an important tool in many applied
              endeavors.  For example, cryptosystems which enable secure transmission of data
              over the internet are based on Number Theory, as are error correcting codes for
              reliable data transmission.
