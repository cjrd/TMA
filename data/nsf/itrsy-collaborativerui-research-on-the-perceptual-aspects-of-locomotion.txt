              This is a standard award to one of three institutions collaborating as partners
              on Thompson's project (0121084).   No current system allows a person to
              naturally walk through a large-scale virtual environment.  The availability of
              such a locomotion interface would have impacts on a broad range of
              applications, including education and training, design and prototyping,
              physical fitness, and rehabilitation;  for some of these applications natural
              walking provides a level of realism not obtainable if movement through the
              simulated world is controlled by devices such as a joystick, while for others
              realistic walking is a fundamental requirement. Prototypes have been built for
              a variety of computer-controlled devices on which a person can walk, but there
              has been little investigation of the utility of such devices as interfaces to a
              virtual world and almost no study at all of the interactions of visual and
              biomechanical perceptual cues in such devices.   This project addresses key
              open questions, the answers to which are needed if locomotion interfaces are to
              offer effective interaction between users and computer simulations.   An
              effective locomotion interface must provide users with accurate visual and
              biomechanical sensations of walking;  thus, a key objective of this work is to
              determine how to synergistically combine visual information generated by
              computer graphics with biomechanical information generated by devices that
              simulate walking on real surfaces.   Thompson and his collaborators will
              investigates methods that allow more accurate walking in a locomotion interface
              while accurately conveying a sense of the spaces being walked through. 
              Specific issues to be considered include how to facilitate the perception of
              speed and distance traveled, how to provide a compelling sense of turning when
              actual walking along a curved path is not possible, how to give a user the
              sense that he/she is walking over a sloped surface, and more generally how to
              give a user a clear sense of the scale and structure of the spaces being walked
              through.   The team's findings on these issues will be relevant across the
              spectrum of possible approaches to locomotion interfaces.
