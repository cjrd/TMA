                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is  to design a
              generic framework for formalizing and automatically extracting domain-specific
              information from unstructured text for the purpose of automatic processing. 
              The rate at which new information becomes available has increased to a point
              that it is impossible for people to identify the nature the information content
              as it is made accessible and even less feasible to absorb the actual
              information content.  Current search technologies solve the problem of finding
              documents, but they do not address the fundamental problem of cognizance of the
              information contained in newly available documents.  Being aware of the
              information content has now become the real challenge.  Therefore it has become
              critical to automatically process information as it becomes available.  The
              framework will handle domain specific areas where language variations are
              wide.
     The commercial applications of Teragram's proffered technology
              include alerts based on content, feature extraction for clustering and
              visualization of large information contents, and structuring data from
              documents into databases for numerous domains, including financial analysis,
              financial earnings releases, sport results, weather forecasts, terrorist
              events, election results, and product price comparisons.
