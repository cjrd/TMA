              The principal goal of this effort is to identify and understand colliding
              Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) preceding complex interplanetary activity: solar
              energetic particle (SEP) events, solar wind structure and composition
              variations, interplanetary ejecta, radio bursts, and geomagnetic storms. 
              Multiple data sources will be employed to (1) identify, list, and characterize
              CME interactions, (2) investigate solar wind signatures 2-4 days following
              colliding, Earth-directed, CMEs, (3) identify large SEP events which exhibit
              mixed impulsive and gradual characteristics and determine their relation (if
              any) to colliding CMEs, (4) classify types of interactions between CMEs, and
              (5) determine if there are solar-cycle dependences of CME interaction
              occurrences and characteristics.
