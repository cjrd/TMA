              This study tests for effects of habitat heterogeneity in population dynamics of
              snowshoe hares, critical prey for many coniferous forest carnivores, including
              Canada lynx. Prevalent hypotheses appeal to habitat heterogeneity and resulting
              source-sink dynamics to explain the lack of hare population cycles in their
              southern range (the contiguous U.S.A.). Veterinary ultrasound and
              radio-telemetry will estimate birth, survival, immigration and emigration rates
              in different forest stand structure types. These estimates will test hypotheses
              of population dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes. Computer models will test
              for influences of landscape configuration on the relative importance of
              different vital rates. An experiment will test for changes in hare abundance
              resulting from pre-commercial thinning, a common silvicultural perturbation in
              forest habitats. 

This study will test theories that explain why certain
              animal populations do or do not cycle from high to low density, a central
              question in ecology. They will also inform federal, state, and private
              management of forested habitats where snowshoe hare population size, and Canada
              lynx population viability, are of concern and provide research training for
              undergraduate student-scientists.
