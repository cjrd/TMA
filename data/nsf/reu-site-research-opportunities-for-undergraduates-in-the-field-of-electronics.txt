               
This award provides funding to SUNY Binghamton for the support of a
              three-year, REU Site in Electronics Packaging, under the direction of Dr.
              Bahgat G. Sammakia.  This ten-week summer program will involve eight students
              annually in the multidisciplinary field of electronics packaging research
              through the Integrated Electronics Engineering Center (IEEC). Students will
              have the opportunity to interact with scientists and engineers from industry. 
              The research teams will include undergraduate students, faculty, graduate
              students, and industrial mentors.  A broad mix of students, including women and
              under-represented minorities, not only from Binghamton but from other
              institutions as well, will be recruited for the program.  While independent
              research will be stressed, students will have the opportunity to experience
              working in a team environment.  Oral and written communication of research
              results will be required.
