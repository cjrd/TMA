              This workshop will bring together key people to discuss opportunities for
              enhancing, via organized computational efforts, the research infrastructure in
              Algebra, Number Theory, and Combinatorics.  The list of anticipated
              participants includes researchers who use computational tools in their
              research, researchers who have developed computational tools for use in
              research, and researchers not currently making significant use of computational
              tools.  An effort is being made to include women and other researchers from
              groups under-represented in mathematics. The outcome of the workshop will be a
              document that will contain general principles, strategies, and long-range goals
              intended to be useful for the program officers in ANTC as they decide on future
              proposal that contain computational aspects.  It is hoped that this document
              will also stimulate further discussion and action within the research
              community.


Some of the main issues that will be addressed at this workshop
              are:
1. What kind of problems do we want to solve?
2. What tools do we
              need?
3. Knowing what tools we need, how to we make them available and how do
              we implement them?
4. How can we simplify the process of making data available
              to anyone who would like to use it?
The workshop is intended as a
              brainstorming session to systematically organize the communities' efforts
              regarding these issues.
