              This project will result in a catalogue of clouds compiled from data sets
              gathered from weather stations, both land (from 1971 onward) and ocean (from
              1952 onward). The basic ocean data set to be used is readily available from
              COADS (the Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set jointly archived by the
              National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Oceanic and
              Atmospheric Administration).

The atlas will be compiled with special
              emphasis on diurnal cycles, interannual variability and long-term trends useful
              for climate studies. Information on total cloud cover, low cloud amount, cloud
              types at three levels (stratus, stratocumulus and fog), types altostratus and
              altocumulus,  and present weather conditions at the time of observation (e.g.,
              precipitation, fog), and cloud base height will be provided. Day and night-time
              observations will be separated. Satellite-based data sets will be used to
              supplement the catalogue with optical properties associated with
              morphologically defined types of cloud.

The cloud catalogue arising from
              this project is expected to prove highly useful to the scientific community for
              climate change studies; for example, in improving estimates of the Earth's
              radiation budget.
