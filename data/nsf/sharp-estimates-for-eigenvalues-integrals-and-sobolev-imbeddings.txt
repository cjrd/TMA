              The author proposes to work on various extremal  problems
for functionals which
              are defined in terms of integrals
or eigenvalues. These problems include:
              Lieb-Thirring
inequalities for the number bound states of Schrodinger
              
operators; sharp Moser-Trudinger and Sobolev inequalities
for the CR sphere,
              with applications to determinants of CR 
invariant operators; sharp
              inequalities for integrals
involving cross-ratios, with applications to zeta
              functions
of Laplacians on the sphere; sharp inequalities of log-Sobolev
type
              on the disk, with applications to zeta functions of
Dirichlet and Neumann
              Laplacians on the disk; dimension
-free Carleson measure inequalities. The
              research will
touch on important questions arising in differential
geometry,
              harmonic analysis, and mathematical physics.

It is difficult to understate
              the importance of eigenvalue
estimates in both applied and theoretical 
              sciences. It is
very often the case that to given physical structures,
              such
as systems of particles, vibrating membranes, or strings,
one can attach
              certain characteristic numerical values,
called "eigenvalues". These numbers
              are important, as some
relevant properties of a given structure can be often
              coded
into numerical functions of the eigenvalues, called
"spectral
              functionals". In an extremal  problem one tries
to find out which structures
              of the same type would
yield the highest (or lowest) possible spectral
              functionals; 
very often,  they are the ones with exhibit the
              most
symmetrical geometry.
