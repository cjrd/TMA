              The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 represent the greatest homeland
              threat to America since Pearl Harbor. As in times of war, the attacks have
              prompted increased patriotism and national identification. This small grant for
              exploratory research will examine Americans' national versus racial/ethnic
              identifications in the wake of the terrorist attacks. Among the questions to be
              addressed are the following: How strongly do Americans identify with their
              national identity? Does national identity correspond with an inclusion of
              traditionally stigmatized groups (e.g., African Americans) into the common
              national in-group? If so, is this inclusion observable in unconscious
              associations of stigmatized groups with the category American? Or, instead, is
              it merely a conscious extension of patriotism, unlinked to underlying
              representations of social categories? What factors predict the magnitude of
              these identity effects? Are these identities durable or will they fade over
              time?

The research entails a multi-site study of white Americans' national
              identities and their inclusion of African- versus Arab-Americans relative to
              the broader category American. To date, empirical examinations of the
              malleability of identity and inter-group bias have been largely limited to
              manipulations involving minimal groups of relatively low self-importance to
              participants. The recent terrorist attacks represent a unique opportunity to
              explore the impact of extreme threats upon social identities of significant
              self-relevance. National identities such as these are likely to be stable
              except in times of relatively severe national threat.
