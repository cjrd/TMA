              Controlling and manipulating molecular building blocks on a nanometer scale is
              the central challenge of the emerging field of nanotechnology.  Nature
              accomplishes this task by synthesizing numerous exact copies of high molecular
              weight protein molecules, with folding and function on nanometer scale encoded
              in the primary sequence of their amino acid monomers.  Thus, the cellular
              apparatus of protein synthesis is uniquely suited for making giant molecules
              with properties controlled on a nanometer scales.  However, natural materials
              also have many shortcomings, both in terms of the available chemical building
              blocks, as well as the limited flexibility of the linear, step-wise protein
              biosynthesis.  Thus, combination of the precise natural biosynthetic process
              with favorable attributes of diverse unnatural synthetic blocks could be used
              to create materials with properties impossible to obtain with purely synthetic
              or natural synthons.  The PI propses a research program aimed at exploring the
              synthesis and applications of novel materials consisting of genetically
              engineered polypeptides (protein polymers) conjugated with synthetic
              macromolecular building blocks: dendrons and/or conventional polymers.  Two
              specific aims will be addressed in the proposed research: (1) development of a
              synthetic route towards monodisperse cylindrical molecules with nanometer-scale
              length and diameter, and controlled distribution of polar and apolar surface
              chemistries, that can be used as building blocks for thin films and monolayers
              with nanoscale molecular ordering; (2) synthesis and processing of composites
              consisting of ordered, nanometer-sized polypeptide blocks dispersed in a
              synthetic polymer matrix, that will have high mechanical strength and toughness
              comparable to or better than those of the natural dragline spider silk
              fibers.

The PI will complement his interdisciplinary research effort with
              a teaching program designed to integrate the biology and materials science
              education.  The PI's ultimate aim is to educate the next generation of
              sscientists and engeineers capable of working at the interface between the two
              disciplines.  This will be realized by designing research projects at the
              interface between biology and polymers science and suitable for both
              undergraduate and graduate research.  Furthermore, the PI will develop three
              new undergraduate materials science classes that will introduce concepts and
              techniques of life sciences to engineering students in the context of
              biomaterials.  Ultimately, the proposed research and training program will
              facilitate the flow of ideas and techniques between the two disciplines.  This
              will then lead to the discovery of new methods for synthesis of materials with
              diversity of functional properties approaching those of natural biopolymers,
              and having stability and processing characteristics suitable for application in
              many areas of nanoscale science and engineering.
