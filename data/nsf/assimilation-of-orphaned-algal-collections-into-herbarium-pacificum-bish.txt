              This project will transfer the Abbott personal collection of marine algae into
              the Bernice P. Bishop Museum's so that future generations of researchers and
              educators may benefit from them.  All information associated with these
              specimens will be databased and assimilated into the Museum's algal collection.
               The correct names of the primary reef-building algae will be resolved.  The
              resulting algal collection will be the most accurate comprehensive
              documentation of algal biodiversity of the Pacific region in the world.

The
              Abbott Collection contains many thousands of valuable seaweed specimens that
              document the marine reef-building floristic biodiversity of the Hawaiian Island
              chain from Kure Atoll to the island of Hawaii and elsewhere in the Pacific. 
              Research, monitoring and resource management efforts, especially pertinent to
              threats of marine invasive species and other environmental changes, are
              substantial activities of many federal, state, and commonwealth governments. 
              Reliable records and accurate taxonomic identifications, with emphasis on the
              reef-building coralline algae, are of major ecological importance in
              understanding the dynamics of reef ecosystems.  These data are crucial to any
              effective resource management throughout the Pacific.  The Museum's virtual
              algal herbarium direct Internet access will enable immediate availability of
              precision information and rapid response via interactive data platforms. 
              Educational benefits will range from general species information and images, to
              accurate known distribution, species range predictability, potential spread of
              invasive species, and ecological changes.
