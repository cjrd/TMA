              Lay Abstract   Murray

This one-day symposium has the goals of bringing
              together investigators working on diverse taxa, and moving the field toward a
              unified framework of the neural mechanisms underlying navigational behaviors.  
               Previous conferences on the subject of orientation and navigation have not
              emphasized neural mechanisms, and a greater understanding of such neural
              mechanisms is now possible using multichannel recording, and newly-developed
              techniques for recording from freely-moving animals.  Eleven speakers will each
              present a 30-minute talk on their work followed by 10 minutes of questions. 
              All speakers will address common problems, models, and mechanisms shared among
              all investigators, with the goal of developing a unifying framework to
              understand the neural circuits utilized as animals find their way over both
              short and long distances.  The objectives of this symposium are as follows: To
              exchange ideas about state-of-the-art neuronal, computational, and behavioral
              approaches to the analysis of oriented locomotion; To seek common neural
              mechanisms of orientation and navigation used by multiple phyla and in diverse
              sensory contexts; And to set short-term and long-term goals common to those
              working on the mechanisms of oriented locomotion toward establishing a general
              theory of the neuronal mechanisms of oriented locomotion.  These general
              mechanisms will inform technologies now developing in the form of mobile
              robots.    This symposium will provide an opportunity for a rich
              cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers studying animal behavior and
              those studying neurobiology.
