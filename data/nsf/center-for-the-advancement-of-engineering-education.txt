              The Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education (CAEE) at the University
              of Washington is advancing the scholarship of engineering learning and teaching
              through a partnership with Stanford University, Colorado School of Mines, the
              University of Minnesota, and Howard University.  CAEE is a multifaceted Higher
              Education Center for Learning and Teaching clustered around three core
              elements:  Scholarship on Learning Engineering, the Program for Enhancing
              Engineering Teaching, and Annual Engineering Education Institutes.   The
              Center's Scholarship on Learning Engineering includes cross-institutional
              longitudinal research studies on learning to engineer focusing on the
              development of engineers from undergraduate education through entry into the
              engineering workforce and targeted studies of core competencies and concepts
              central to engineering.  Professional development activities under the Center's
              Program for Enhancing Engineering Teaching (PEET) include the identification of
              resources to help engineering faculty address teaching challenges, thematic and
              research-to-practice workshops for future and current faculty, an engineering
              teaching portfolio initiative for graduate students, and the development of the
              Engineering Teaching Source, a web-based tool to enable engineering educators
              and instructional developers to locate high quality teaching resources.  Annual
              Engineering Education Institutes for engineering faculty and graduate students
              build and sustain the community of engineering education scholars.  The
              Institutes are advancing the engineering education research infrastructure by
              increasing the number of people able to conduct rigorous research and to become
              leaders in engineering education research and change agents in engineering
              education.  This project is jointly funded by the Division of Undergraduate
              Education in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources and the Division
              of Engineering and Education Centers in the Directorate for Engineering.
