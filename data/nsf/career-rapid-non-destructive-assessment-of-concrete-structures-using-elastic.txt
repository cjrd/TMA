              This proposal offers an approach for rapid and accurate non-destructive
              evaluation (NDE) to assess the in-place condition of concrete structures.
              Sensitive and practical NDE techniques are of great value to agencies that
              govern the infrastructure. However, the time and effort required to perform
              current NDE tests and to analyze the results limit widespread application. This
              proposal aims to develop a rapid and robust method to collect elastic wave data
              from a concrete structure and an approach for imaging structures that
              characterizes the location, type and magnitude of damaged areas. The proposed
              approach makes use of several innovations including (a) use of surface-guided
              waves, (b) sensitive, non-contact wave reception techniques such as air-coupled
              transducers and laser interferometry, (c) one-sided, point source, point
              receiver NDE measurements such as surface wave transmission and velocity scans,
              and (d) an imaging approach that makes use of the developed measurement data.
              An educational plan is closely integrated with the proposed research.  The
              intent of the educational plan is to design an undergraduate and graduate
              engineering curriculum at Drexel University that responds to current needs of
              the infrastructure industry. The plan also includes additional educational
              outreach to encourage inner-city students to pursue a career in
              engineering.
