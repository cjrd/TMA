A critical first step in characterizing gene function is
              defining the expression pattern of a gene. A novel methodology is being
              developed in plants to rapidly determine the cell-type specific expression of
              thousands of transcripts in concert. The technique involves separating plant
              cells by protoplasting transgenic lines that express GFP in specific cell
              types, obtaining an enriched population of GFP expressing cells using a
              Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS), and applying mRNA isolated from
              sorted cells to microarrays. The result is an expression profile from a
              specific cell type. Extensive controls have been performed and a first round of
              the entire protocol with a single transgenic line has been completed. The
              results are extremely promising with microarray profiles of specific genes in
              agreement with their independently confirmed expression patterns in the
              Arabidopsis root. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) Further test and develop
              the methodology.   2) Expand the number of sorted cell lines.  3) Develop
              computational tools to analyze and disseminate the data. The risk associated
              with this project is balanced by the enormous potential benefit to the plant
              community.
