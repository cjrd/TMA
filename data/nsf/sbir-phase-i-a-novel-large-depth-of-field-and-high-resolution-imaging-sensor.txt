              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project's objective is to
              overcome the drawbacks of existing imaging sensor designs, and to demonstrate a
              novel video camera design concept.  Named the Super-Eye, this camera is able to
              provide simultaneously both large depth of field the dynamic scene and
              selective high-resolution video images for the object of interest. The unique
              advantages of the proposed Super-Eye concept include: (a) achieving
              simultaneous high image resolution and large depth of field; (b) Intelligent
              guidance of the high-resolution image channel; and (c) 3D Modeling
              Capability.

The requirements for high image resolution, large depth of
              field, and wide field of view are applicable to both the commercial and
              military markets.  The security surveillance market has experience near
              double-digit growth and is expected to maintain this growth in light of the
              events of 9/11. Security cameras are roughly 30 percent of the $100 billion
              global security industry.
