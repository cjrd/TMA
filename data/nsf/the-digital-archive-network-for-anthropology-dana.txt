              This award has established a digital library collection for anthropological
              materials. Faculty, students, and staff affiliated with the Archaeology
              Technologies Laboratory (ATL) and the World Wide Web Instructional Committee
              (WWWIC) at North Dakota State University (NDSU) are developing and implementing
              the pilot program for the Digital Archive Network for Anthropology (DANA), a
              network infrastructure for the seamless linking of distributed databases with
              content of relevance to the domain of anthropology. The PI's are actively
              collaborating with other individuals and institutions to develop a management
              process for the operation of the digital archive and the policies and practices
              necessary for quality assurance. Through this
collaboration, standards that
              promote stability, interoperability, and reusability of materials and products
              are being developed. A unique feature of this Archive is the inclusion of
              accurate, measurable, three-dimensional (3D) models of the material objects
              along with 2D images and digitized documents.
Specific goals of the project
              are as follows:
- Refine the protocol for creating accurate, measurable 3D
              models through digitization that can be retrieved, inspected, and analyzed;
-
              Develop applications and protocols to enable the sharing of data worldwide;
-
              Improve current Java applications and client servlets for data searching and
              retrieval;
- Continuously evaluate the efficacy of our Java applications and
              our servlets;
- Develop software modules to enable search and retrieval access
              to linked databases by way of specially designed searching interfaces and
              common search protocols;
- Collaborate with colleagues across the country and
              abroad to develop metadata compliant information structure for archiving and
              accessing digital models;
- Use eXtensible Markup Language (XML) as the
              primary medium for information exchange;
- Create an anthropology markup
              language (AnthML) for facilitating information exchange;
- Develop a series of
              software tools that provide varying levels of morphometric analyses so users
              can select the level of search and analysis appropriate to their needs;
-
              Establish a set of collaborating institutions that will develop and maintain
              participating databases;
- Establish a DANA Advisory Board;
- Establish a set
              of criteria for content standards and quality control;
- Provide academic
              training in all of the areas covered by ATL activities mentioned
              above.
State-of-the-art technology for digital archiving and distributed
              networking is being employed to develop DANA, the content of which will be
              available via the Internet and will promote sharing of data while still
              protecting pre-published data and culturally sensitive objects and
              information.
