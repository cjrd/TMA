              This project is addressing the need to improve the mathematics learning
              environment in two-year colleges by generating increased student enthusiasm in
              the exploration and applications of mathematics and by attracting more students
              to science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) fields of study.
              The overall project goal is to provide faculty with a complete package of
              information and materials for establishing and conducting an interdisciplinary
              course for the study of mathematics. The package includes (a) ten laboratory
              exercises, each having a technology problem, a bibliotechnology research
              exercise, a method to develop the mathematics tools required to solve the
              problem, a model portfolio, and a thesis defense; (b) initiation of a marketing
              plan; and (c) initiation of a management plan. Means to accomplish the project
              objectives involve in-kind support from the American Mathematical Association
              of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC), Texas Instruments, and Capital Community
              College. Twenty AMATYC faculty members have been selected to produce the ten
              laboratories.

Project outcomes include a laboratory, marketing, and
              management plan, all of which are being compiled into The Math Works Resource
              Book, to be published in hard copy and via the Internet. This project is
              offering a multitude of professional enhancement opportunities to those who
              develop or use the products developed through this project.
