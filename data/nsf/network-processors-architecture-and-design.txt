              Two forces have exacerbated problems associated with packet processing. First,
              demands for higher bandwidth and line rates challenge our abilities to perform
              real-time packet processing. Second, more complex functional requirements and
              services are being defined that significantly increase packet computational
              demand. 

In response, modern routers are being equipped with Network
              Processors (NPs) that include both general-purpose multiprocessing and special
              hardware capabilities. NPs push the envelope of our design capabilities. This
              research aims at quantifying NP design and at developing a performance driven
              methodology that is cognizant of both physical constraints (e.g., area, power)
              and the computational requirements of packet applications.

Principal
              architectural approaches (parallelism, pipelining, instruction specialization)
              are investigated and design procedures for exploiting these architectural
              paradigms are developed. The NP architecture models along with associated
              benchmarking lead to a coherent NP design methodology and extend our
              understanding of real-time computer design.

The research directly benefits
              the rapidly expanding area of NP and router design, and network performance.
              The techniques utilized are those of classical computer architecture, including
              the formalization of the design constraints, development of design models, and
              the use of benchmarks for quantitative model parameterization.
