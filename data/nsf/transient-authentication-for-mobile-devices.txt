              users must prove their identity from time to time, and this authentication is
              assumed to hold for all user requests until it is either explicitly or
              implicitly revoked.  This model is poorly matched to mobile devices, which are
              prone to loss or theft.  An adversary, holding the device of a trusted user,
              has the full authority of that user for the remainder of the authentication
              period.  Systems that require more frequent authentication are burdensome;
              users disable or work around such safeguards, forfeiting their protection. This
              problem is addressed by a technique called transient authentication.  Rather
              than invest long-term authority with a mobile device---something easily set
              down or stolen---it is retained within a small authentication token worn by the
              user.  

This research explores the implications of making authentication,
              traditionally a persistent property, into a transient one.  Transient
              authentication will be applied to process state and file system state.  An
              application programming interface (API) will be designed, and a number of
              applications and services ported to it.  The system will be evaluated through
              controlled benchmarking, establishing the claims of performance and usability. 
              The resulting system will provide strong protection against loss or theft
              without inconveniencing authorized users.
