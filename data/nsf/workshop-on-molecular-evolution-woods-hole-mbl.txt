	The Workshop on Molecular Evolution, now in its 12th year of
              NSF support, is held for two weeks in the summer at the Woods Hole, MA, Marine
              Biological Laboratory to provide a rich and intensive learning experience for
              60 students in the broad field of molecular evolutionary studies. Specific
              workshop objectives include: (1) to provide advanced training in practical,
              theoretical, and analytical aspects of molecular evolution; (2) to provide
              advanced training in computational resources and statistical and modelling
              techniques related to molecular biology, phylogenetics, and population
              genetics; (3) to promote molecular evolutionary approaches to questions in
              biological fields like anthropology, conservation genetics, development,
              behavior, physiology, and ecology; and (4) to expand accessibility and reach of
              the Workshop through the workshop's web site. These objectives are realized
              through a series of lectures by invited specialists, demonstrations, and
              computer training for 60 students drawn from throughout the country and abroad.
              
	Students receive intensive, high-level instruction and hands-on training in
              the use of major software employed in molecular evolutionary studies. Workshop
              faculty also learn about the latest developments in the field, and from each
              other, in ways that promote their own scientific research. Teaching assistants
              extend their knowledge and understanding of recent developments, assist in
              computer laboratory demonstrations and tutorials, and lead discussions
              regarding teaching strategies and pedagogy. The workshop helps promote
              understanding of molecular evolution and evolutionary genomics to society at
              large, and has involved science reporters and other communicators in years past
              as well as scientists from other Federal agencies.
