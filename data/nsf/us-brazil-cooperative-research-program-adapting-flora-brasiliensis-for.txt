This Americas Program award will support Dr. Paul E. Berry
              of the University of Wisconsin Madison in collaboration with Dr. George J.
              Shepherd and Dr. Maria de Carmo Amaral, both of the Instituto de Biologia
              (UNICAMP).  The aim of this project is to initiate the revaluation of Martius'
              great work and explore the feasibility of presenting Flora Brasiliensis in
              facsimile form on the World Wide Web, including corrections for the now
              outdated taxonomy.  The following steps will be taken: (1) Develop a pilot Web
              page, (2) Evaluate the cost of digitizing and indexing images only, (3) Contact
              and recruit active systematists worldwide to update the taxonomy and
              nomenclature of the published treatments in the Flora, (4) Use the concept of
              this project as a springboard to help produce new regional and national
              floristic treatments in Brazil and neighboring areas.  The long-term goal is to
              develop a complete Neotropical checklist of vascular plants and contribute more
              fully towards floristic treatments within tropical South America.  

This
              project will build strong and lasting international ties between key
              institutions involved in plant diversity efforts as well as strengthen
              international ties between systematic biologists and discourage isolationist
              tendencies in individual countries where the greatest biodiversity is found.
