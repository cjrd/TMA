              This four-year Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) project at the
              University of New Mexico, with Professor Timothy Ward as principal
              investigator, will investigate the potential to spatially engineer the
              structure and composition of porous composite nanoparticles with
              functionalities not previously achieved.  The research will focus on particles
              whose basic scaffolding is a precisely organized inorganic (oxide)
              nanostructure created by self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules and hydrophilic
              precursors.  The synthesis of silica/surfactant self-assembly will rely on
              evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) within confined environment of an
              evaporating droplet as opposed to nucleated self-assembly conducted in bulk
              solution.   Using the EISA technique, four general classes of particle
              architecture, some containing functional components positioned within or at the
              surfaces of particles, will be investigated.  The resultant functionalized
              nanoparticles and composites could provide a reservoir for sensing or
              therapeutic agents whose action or delivery is coupled to molecular recognition
              functionality at the particle surface and is mediated by controlled transfer
              through nanoporous channels.
