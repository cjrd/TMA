The main goal of this project is to determine
              rate laws for exchange of individual oxygens between structural sites in large
              clay-like aluminum complexes and water.  The aluminum nanoclusters are chosen
              to have structural elements in common with soil mineral surfaces and a similar
              surface charge density of protons.  Unlike bulk studies of mineral reactions
              with fluid, our experiments yield information about rate laws for exchange of
              individual oxygens with the bulk solution at a scale that is suitable for
              computer simulation.  This molecular-scale research requires reconsideration of
              much current thinking about mechanisms for mineral reaction in water.  For
              example: 1) The important oxygens for mineral dissolution are apparently highly
              coordinated oxygens deeper in the molecule.  2) Proton transfer to the bridging
              hydroxyls, which precedes exchange of the oxygens, commonly takes place
              internally and not by proton uptake from the solution.  3) Dissociation of a
              surface-bound water molecule controls the rates of many adsorption reactions,
              yet the rates at individual sites are largely unknown.  We find that these
              solvolysis rates for large polyoxocations fall into the same range as dissolved
              aluminum monomers, suggesting that the rates for edges of clays and protonated
              aluminum hydroxide minerals are similar.  4) The rates of oxygen exchange are
              highly sensitive to metal substitutions, in ways that could not have been
              anticipated from bulk studies or by changes in from bond lengths determined by
              X-ray crystallography.
