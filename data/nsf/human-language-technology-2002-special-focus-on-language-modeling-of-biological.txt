              This will support a special focus workshop at the Human Language Technology
              Conference in the area of Language Processing of Biological Data.  The purpose
              of this special focus within HLT 2002 context is to bring to the attention of a
              wide audience of researchers across all aspects of human language technology
              the research opportunites and recent research breakthroughs in this newly
              emerging area.  This support is also  intended to further promote
              cross-disciplinary approaches to the new field of bioinformatics.
