              This award to Carnegie-Mellon University is supported by the Advanced Materials
              Program In the Chemistry Division.The goal of the research by Professor Richard
              D. McCullough is to design, synthesize, assemble and engineer new defect-free,
              regioregular polythiophenes in order to denonstrate and understand
              self-assembly in conjugated polymers as a way to optimize material properties
              and to create new functional properties. New synthetic routes will be developed
              and new insights into structure-property relationships wil be gained. Specific
              targets will be the development of new regioregular, amphiphilic polythiophene
              coplymers and polythiophene polyelectrolytes, the synthesis of new
              multifunctional polymers that have high conductivities, good mechanical
              properties and environmental stability, and the development of sensors and
              biosensors based on new polythiophene materials.

Regioregular polythiophenes
              are well-defined conducting polymers whose properties can be tuned to novel
              applications such as ink-jet printing, wires and contacts, polymer switches and
              colorimetric biosensors. The  scope of the research in synthesis,
              characterization, fabrication and performance measurement will provide students
              with broad interdisciplinary training.
