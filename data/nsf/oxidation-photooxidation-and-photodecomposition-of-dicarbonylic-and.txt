              This project involves quantitative studies on the photochemistry of the
              carbonylic group as pertains to photodecomposition of organic contaminants in
              ice cores and is thereby aimed at accounting for excess carbon monoxide and
              carbon dioxide gas levels observed in deep ice cores.  Such ambiguities may
              increase significantly uncertainties associated with using ice cores to study
              issues of importance to the relevance and representativeness of paleoclimate
              records.  Specifically, the project will use a combination of spectroscopic
              techniques and chemical analyses to characterize a variety of selected ice
              dopants, and subsequently investigate their photochemical reactions and
              transformations under monochromatic light at wavelengths at and above the
              near-UV, and further measure gaseous formation rates in synthesized ice
              mixtures containing a laboratory surrogate mineral dust.  This study should
              lead to a better understanding of photochemical processes occurring in deep ice
              cores and provide important data required for a scientific evaluation of the
              possible mechanisms of corruption of historical ice records.  The fundamental
              nature of the research as it applies to our future understanding of the
              paleoclimate ice core record addresses broader scientific impacts upon
              geoclimate, and broader scientific community impacts are addressed through
              scholarship, community involvement, technology transfer and capacity-building
              by outreach, minority and underrepresented group involvement, as well as
              mentoring and research direction of young geoscientists.
