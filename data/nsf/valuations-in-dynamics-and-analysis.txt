ABSTRACT

The principal
              investigator will use valuations, 
a tool from algebra, to study local
              problems 
in dynamics and analysis in two complex dimensions. 
Valuations can
              be visualized  concretely as the
different ways that a sequence of points can
              converge
to the origin. In fact, they parameterize all the
local data at a
              point. Local phenomena in complex variables, 
such as the singularity of a
              plurisubharmonic functions 
or the rate of convergence of an orbit to a fixed
              point,
can be effectively studied by observing the behavior along
different
              approaches to the point. Valuations constitute a
very powerful tool for this
              study. The success of the
approach depends on the fact that the set of all
              valuations
at a point in two dimensions is a set that can be understood:
it
              is a tree in the sense of an infinite collection of real 
intervals welded
              together at branch points so that no cycles
appear. This tree is a complicated
              but manageable object
and its one-dimensionality has striking
              applications.

Dynamical systems are mathematical models that are widely
              
used in virtually every science for any situation that
undergoes a
              time-evolution. Sir Isaac Newton invented
calculus, or mathematical analysis,
              for the study of the
planetary system, a prime example of a dynamical
              system.
Much of mathematics has developed as a respond to the need
to model
              and understand the world around us.
In this proposal the principal
              investigator will use a tool
from a different field of mathematics in order to
              understand
certain dynamical systems. One example of a system
that can be
              studied arises from numerical (iterative) 
algorithms, and the study of the
              dynamical systems in 
this proposal will give information on the performance
              of 
the algorithms.
