                                        Several important questions about the nature of the
              subduction process require a transition from existing qualitative subduction
              signals, such as Ba/La and 10Be/9Be, to quantitative fluxes such as Ba flux in
              gm/unit arc length/yr. This is accomplished by employing 40Ar/39Ar dating
              techniques to measure the ages of the older units in several large Central
              American volcanic centers. These new data, along with previously determined
              volume measurements, enable the determination of average volcanic flux rates
              for different segments of the arc. Integrating volcanic flux rates with
              regional geochemical data allows an estimate of element fluxes to be made. From
              these integrated data several major problems are being addressed, including the
              physical cause of along-strike variations in subduction signal in Central
              America, the mass balance of elements cycling through the Central American arc,
              and the quantity of incompatible elements that are delivered to the deep mantle
              through subduction.
