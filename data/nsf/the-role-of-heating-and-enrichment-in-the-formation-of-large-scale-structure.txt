Evan Scannapieco

Dr. Scannapieco will carry out a program of
              research as an MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellow at
              the Osseratorio Astrofisico di Arcetri, Italy, and the Institut
              d'Astrophysique, Paris.  His theoretical and observational program will examine
              heating and enrichment processes in the Universe and their impact on the
              formation of large-scale structure.  The observational program will carry out
              the most accurate spectroscopic examination of distant outflows yet undertaken,
              as well as a search for heated gas around distant galaxies in the Hubble Deep
              Field.  The observational research will be complemented by three closely
              related theoretical projects: 1) a detailed numerical study of galaxy outflows
              that will help to better quantify the role outflows play in the thermal and
              enrichment history of the diffuse gas from which all galaxies form, 2) a study
              of how this enrichment history can be related to the metal distribution in the
              stars of our own galaxy, and 3) a numerical study of the impact of outflows on
              the cosmic microwave background radiation, one of the most sensitive probes of
              the heating and ionization history of the Universe. This research is funded
              through the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
