              This U.S.-Hungarian research project involves two teams led by Piers Coleman of
              Rutgers University, New Brunswick, and his partner Alfred Zawadowski of the
              Physics Institute at the Technical University, Budapest.  Their collaboration
              features examination of strongly correlated systems with an emphasis on quantum
              criticality and superconductivity in heavy fermion systems and electronic
              correlation effects in mesoscopic devices.  These researchers found motivation
              in recent experiments performed at the magnetic quantum critical point of a
              heavy fermion metal and in nano-science developments that enable measurements
              and observations of strongly correlated states in single electron
              devices.

The project's research plan features study of: 1) magnetic quantum
              critical point in the Kondo lattice; 2) superconducting order in heavy fermion
              compounds and 3) dynamical and out-of equilibrium properties of quantum dots. 
              Various numerical and analytical methods will be employed including slave
              particle methods and large N expansions; perturbative renormalization group
              techniques and e-expansions; and dynamical mean field theory calculations
              combined with numerical renormalization group methods.  If successful, findings
              should contribute to our knowledge of new phenomena on a nanometer scale that
              may be applicable in specially fabricated materials. 

This international
              research project in materials theory fulfills the program objective of
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied States and
              Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
