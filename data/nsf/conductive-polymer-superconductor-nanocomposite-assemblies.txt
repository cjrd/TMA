              This research program targets the design, preparation and characterization of
              novel conductive polymer / cuprate superconductor nano-composite assemblies.
              These hybrid structures will be generated in such a manner that the electrical
              communication between the two component conductors is maximized with the goal
              of fostering the flow of supercurrent into the polymer over macroscopically
              large distances. Novel low temperature transport measurements completed with
              superconductor / polymer / superconductor nano-bridges will allow for the
              exploration of the low temperature electron-transfer phenomena and proximity
              effects that occur in such hybrid systems. This new program will target
              experiments in the following four areas: a) molecular engineering of conductive
              polymer compounds for cryogenic applications; b) direct observation of
              polymeric proximity effects using scanning probe methods; c) supercurrent flow
              through polymer / superconductor nano-bridges; and d) suppression of
              superconductivity in conductive polymer coated ultra-thin high-Tc films.
              Through this highly interdisciplinary program, a series of scientists will be
              trained in the important emerging area of hybrid electronic materials.

The
              integration of electronically conductive polymers into functional
              superconductor-based structures is leading to a variety of new sensors and
              devices which may exhibit enhanced sensitivity and selectivity that is not
              currently available with the conventional devices. This interdisciplinary
              program targets the preparation and characterization of a new class of
              conductive polymer / high-Tc superconductor nano-composite assemblies. In
              addition to the important knowledge base that will be derived from these
              studies, it should be emphasized that this program possesses an important
              educational component. Indeed, through this highly interdisciplinary program a
              series of scientists will be trained in the important emerging area of hybrid
              electronic materials with enhanced processibility, molecular tunability and
              interesting sensor / display capabilities available with such polymeric
              compounds.
