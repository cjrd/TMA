     The investigator and his colleagues study nonlinear
              problems
from meteorology, oceanography, and fluid mechanics, using
              the
mathematical tools offered by analysis, the theory of nonlinear
partial
              differential equations, dynamical systems theory, and
computation.  The part
              of this project related to meteorology and
oceanography focuses on the
              following areas: (1)  Open boundary
conditions for limited domain simulations
              and well posedness
issues for meteorology and oceanography problems. (2) 
              Balanced
and unbalanced models in atmosphere sciences. (3) 
              Well-posedness
and stability problems in oceanography.  The fluid
              mechanics
topics focus on several aspects of turbulence theory, including
the
              connection between the conventional theory of turbulence, the
dynamical
              systems approach, and the Navier-Stokes equations.  The
investigators intend
              also to complete a research monograph on
some of these aspects of
              turbulence.
     Central problems in meteorology and oceanography
              are
concerned with understanding and predicting the behavior of
              the
atmosphere and the ocean --- in what patterns do these fluids,
air and
              water, move?  The mathematical equations that describe
the motions are
              difficult to analyze, and computations are also
difficult because the physical
              phenomena are complex and
nonlinear.  In fluid mechanics, understanding fluid
              flows
generally and turbulence in particular, and developing
              efficient
numerical methods to compute these flows, are major themes. 
              The
investigators study several problems related to the behavior
              of
atmosphere and ocean fluid flows and to their effective
computation.  They
              also study and develop computational methods
for turbulent fluid flows of
              importance for industrial processes.
