              and Computational Chemistry Program through a CAREER award to develop accurate
              quantum chemistry methods for large-sized molecular systems and to apply these
              methods to problems in atmospheric chemistry.  In particular, she will develop
              a hierarchy for, and understanding of, density functional methods that evaluate
              accuracy and precision for larger chemical systems by examining the interplay
              between basis set choice and functional choice.  In addition, she will develop
              a distance-learning web course on computational chemistry.

Computational
              chemistry has advanced so significantly that it is an essential complement to
              experiment.  This project will result in improved accuracy and extended
              predictive capabilities for these methods, and contribute to the understanding
              of atmospheric processes.  Also, the development of web-based courses will
              assist the next generation of students pursuing careers in chemistry by
              training them in these techniques.
