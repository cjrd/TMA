              In this project supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program
              of the Chemistry Division, Schwartz will study chemical reaction dynamics in
              condensed phases and complex systems using both quantum mechanical and
              classical methods. The PI will develop his existing approach to extended modes
              in liquids as well as a quantum Kramers methodology for examining the dynamics
              of chemical reactions in condensed phases.  A new enzymatic system will be
              studied in detail using both this quantum methodology and a classical approach
              to discover rate-promoting vibrations in complex systems.  The investigation of
              the dynamics of enzyme reactions and the search for "promoting vibrations"
              addresses central problems in chemical and biological systems, such as the
              catalytic importance of such vibrations.

This project presents a balance
              between developing new theory and applying it to interesting and important
              problems in both isotropic fluid systems as well as in highly anisotropic
              environments such as enzymes.  The proposed research will provide an approach
              for predicting rates for chemical reactions in which quantum effects are
              important.  The results are applicable to biological systems as well as to
              systems in other branches of chemistry and materials science where electron-
              and proton-transfer reactions are important.
