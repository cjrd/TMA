              This Major Research Instrumentation RUI grant supports the acquisition of a
              scanning probe microscope (SPM)) for use in materials research and education.
              The selected SPM allows for temperature variation using hot and cold stages.
              For research purposes, the instrument has the needed measurement modes,
              sensitivity, resolution, and acquisition software to examine
              composition-structure-property relationships of elastomers and polymers,
              investigate magnetic domains and twin boundaries in magnetic shape memory
              alloys, assess surface roughness in thin films, characterize the defect
              structure in anisotropic superconductors, and provide quantitative feedback
              regarding dimension and quality of nanoimprinted features. These are topics
              that impact telecommunications, micromachining, industrial processing, polymer
              science, and nanotechnology industries. Several courses will benefit from SPM's
              broad array of scanning measurement capabilities, which include mapping of
              surface topography, hardness, elastic moduli, contact friction, magnetic
              domains, and tunneling current.

Polymer science, nanotechnology, and
              magnetism have been extensively used in the development of new technologies and
              there is continued demand for fundamental research within these various fields
              of materials science. Without a doubt, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has
              spearheaded many recent advances in these fields. Acquisition of an SPM will
              permit the faculty to expand current research efforts and continue to foster
              interdisciplinary collaborations already underway. In addition, the acquisition
              will allow researchers to initiate new projects with industry and will help
              prepare students for creative contributions in these areas.
