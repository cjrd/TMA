              This proposal is to plan for a new partner to join an existing mutli-university
              I/UCRC that aims to promote a research program of interest to both industry and
              universities on supply chain management. This existing multi-university center
              will be able to have an even broader impact on the industry through having its
              existing resources enhanced by the addition of this partner and the other two
              partners that are also being recommended to receive a planning grant.  Three
              partners, of which this is one are the University of Florida, Lehigh University
              and the University of Minnesota.

The proposed Center's goal is to focus on
              tackling the sophisticated  challenges and interdependencies of logistic and
              distribution, simplifying and advancing communications systems by identifying
              new circuits and new circuit-design techniques as well as new methods in
              systems design and information technology.

The new partners will bring to
              the existing center, a focus on:
- Demonstrating the value of operations
              research in business operations
- Enabling industry partners to harness
              available technologies, and 
- Creating new practice-based research and
              education models for engineering curricula. 

The proposal deals with an area
              of significant need and by assembling these  three additional institutions into
              an already strong team,  their added breadth and depth enhances the prospects
              for success.   The existing institutions in this Center, together with the
              three new ones will be a national resource on this topic.
