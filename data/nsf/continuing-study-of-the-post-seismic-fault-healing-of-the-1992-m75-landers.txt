	We propose to continue our
              study of the post-seismic healing process on Landers, California, rupture zone
              using fault-zone seismic waves excited by explosions detonated within the
              rupture zone. Repeated surveys in 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000 have revealed that
              the shear velocity of the fault zone rock increased by ~1.2% between 1994 and
              1996, and increased further by ~0.7% between 1996 and 1998. This trend
              indicates the Landers rupture zone has been healing by strengthening after the
              mainshock, most likely due to the closure of cracks that opened during the 1992
              earthquake. The observed velocity increase between 1994 and 1998 is consistent
              with a decrease of ~0.03 in apparent crack density within the rupture zone. We
              also found that cracks near the fault zone was partially water-filled and
              became more wet with time. However, the data recorded in the most recent
              experiment showed that wave velocities in the shallow rupture zone did not
              increase further more but with a slight decrease for shear velocity between
              1998 and 2000, inferring that the fault healing probably became invisible since
              6 to 8 years after the 1992 earthquake. However, we speculate that the healing
              process on Landers rupture zone might have been affected by the M7.1 Hector
              Mine earthquake on October 25, 1999, occurring only ~25 km east of Landers. The
              Hector Mine mainshock triggered slip on the neighboring faults as shown in the
              InSAR data and could cause crack opening or coalescence in the shallow crust
              due to strong shaking and change in the mean stress in the region. We shall
              conduct a repeated experiment in 2001-2002. The new data will help us to
              determine if the healing process on the Landers rupture zone was affected by
              the Hector Mine earthquake or has become invisible. We shall compare the
              healing process on the Landers rupture zone with that on the Hector Mine
              rupture zone for which we are monitoring from November of 2000. We shall
              develop a mechanical model based on crack dilatancy theory to interpret the
              fault healing quantitatively.
