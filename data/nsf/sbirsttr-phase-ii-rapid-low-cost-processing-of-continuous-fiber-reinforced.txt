                   This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II Project will
              validate the polymer infiltration/microwave pyrolysis (PIMP) process and
              ceramic product whose feasibility was demonstrated in Phase I. The Phase I
              project demonstrated a reduction in pyrolysis time of greater than 90%; the
              Phase II project will confirm a corresponding cost reduction.  During the Phase
              I, a strategic partnership with a major original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
              was established. The Phase II project will refine the process to produce
              ceramic parts for a specific commercial application, and will validate the
              weight and performance enhancements projected in Phase I. The PIMP process will
              be expanded to the pilot plant scale, and with the collaboration of the OEM and
              a business development specialist.
     Commercial applications exist for
              fiber-reinforced ceramics, if they can be produced at low cost.  The potential
              applications range from gas-fired turbine engines for power plants and aircraft
              to brakes, waste incineration and chemical production.
