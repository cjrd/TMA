              This SGER grew out of an EU-US workshop held in Venice in October, 2002. The
              intent of that workshop was to bring together researchers from the US with
              those from the EU who were working on similar projects related to e-work and
              e-business and who would like to begin to collaborate together. This SGER will
              allow for US cooperation with the EU's STAR project, which involves the conduct
              of dozens of case studies mapping change in a variety of industries across
              member states of the EU. This project will focus on the home mortgage service
              sector, in particular specialized lenders, and will bring the US and one its
              industries into the collection. Case study protocols will be developed that
              will allow for cross-comparison with the EU case studies that have already been
              completed. In addition, travel to the EU will allow for a team meeting and
              coordination of project goals, methods, and analysis.
