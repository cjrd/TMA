              	A close relationship between linear elliptic and parabolic partial differential
              equations and Markov diffusion processes played an important role in the
              development of both fields during the last century. A new chapter in this
              direction -- an interplay between a class of semilinear equations and
              superdiffusions -- has evolved over the past 15 or so years. The theory has
              reached a certain stage of maturity. However some key problems remain open (for
              instance, the uniqueness of the solution with a given fine trace and the
              structure of exit boundaries of superdiffusions). The work on these problems is
              the subject of the proposal. 
	Superdiffusions is a special class of branching
              measure-valued processes also known as superprocesses. Outside of pure
              mathematics, they play a significant role in population genetics and they
              provide new tools for the study of complex physical systems with infinitely
              many degrees of freedom. For about two decades these processes have attracted
              the efforts of many investigators around the world.
