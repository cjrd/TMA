              The proposal is to establish a US-EU/DELOS working group on "Digital Imagery for
              Significant Cultural and Historical Materials".  The working group will meet
              over the next year to discuss and evaluate fruitful joint activities and
              research paths for collaborative activities in this general topical area.   The
              EU component of the effort is funded and managed by the DELOS Forum, a major
              organizer of digital libraries research and planning activities in Europe.  
              DELOS receives support from the Information Societies Technologies (IST) 5th
              Framework Programme of the European Commission.

This effort continues the
              planning and assessment activities begun by an earlier NSF-EU working groups'
              process.   In their final report "An International Research Agenda for Digital
              Libraries", delivered in Brussels in October 1998, increased levels of
              collaboration and interaction was seen as critical to building multi-lingual,
              multi-national digital libraries. The objective of the new working groups, of
              which this is one, is to define a research agenda on a specific topic and
              identify areas and activities for cooperation between EU and US researchers.  
              The efforts of this particular group take the next step in the planning process
              by assessing fruitful research activities and resource development related to
              digital imagery collections.
