This exploratory research studies an ancient trade route
              between northern Myanmar (Burma), Tibet and Yunnan Province of China. The
              principal investigator, an anthropologist, and a photojournalist will travel
              where few outsiders have ever received permission to travel, the Hkakabo Razi
              region of Myanmar. The project will examine trade relationships between
              highland people of Myanmar and Tibetan traders, exchanging salt for forest
              products. They will gather information on the history of trade relations and
              kinship ties in the region, with an eye towards documenting the traditional
              pattern of behavior before rapid change begins. The research is important as it
              will provide a baseline of information about the Taron people living in this
              little-known region. This sort of research also provides valuable data about
              the persistence of cultural groups in isolated regions.
