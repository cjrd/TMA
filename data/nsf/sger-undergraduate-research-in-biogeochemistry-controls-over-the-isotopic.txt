              important greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming. Soil nitrogen
              transformations that lead to production of N2O are extremely dynamic after
              wildfire in forest ecosystems. This project will examine these dynamics using a
              recent wildfire near Flagstaff, Arizona. Two distinct groups of bacteria
              produce N2O in soils. Because these bacteria are sensitive to different
              environmental conditions, understanding their relative contributions to N2O
              production is important in predicting future N2O fluxes. Stable isotopes of
              nitrogen and oxygen in N2O have been proposed as signatures of the particular
              microbial processes responsible for N2O production, but this idea has never
              been explicitly tested in the field. This work will involve undergraduate
              students in research using the natural dynamics of N2O production after fire to
              test to what extent these isotopic 'fingerprints' reliably indicate the
              bacterial groups producing N2O evolved from soil.
