EI:  An Integrated
              Undergraduate Program in Bioinformatics

This project involves the
              development of an interdisciplinary, integrated undergraduate program in
              bioinformatics. In particular, the project's goal includes the design of a
              program of undergraduate study that embodies an interdisciplinary synthesis of
              the topics in computer science and biology required for graduates to
              successfully pursue careers in bioinformatics. The project also plans to
              implement, test, and refine the program of study so that it may be used as a
              prototype for similar curricula at universities nation-wide. Pedagogy foci are
              to design, integrate, and test approaches for teaching topics in bioinformatics
              while providing research experiences for all students in the program. The
              project is strengthened by the participation of a group of academic,
              government, and industry bioinformatics researchers and professionals who act
              as an advisory committee. The emerging science of bioinformatics seeks to
              develop computational algorithms and techniques for analyzing large biological
              databases in search of information that can be applied to specific problems in
              the life sciences. This project addresses the education of professionals with a
              background in this field and contributes to satisfying a nationally growing
              workforce need.
