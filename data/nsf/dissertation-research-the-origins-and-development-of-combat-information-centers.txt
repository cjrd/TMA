              This dissertation research project is an historical study of the United States
              Navy's efforts to develop sophisticated "command and control" technologies
              prior to and during the Second World War. Specifically, it explores the
              development of Combat Information Centers (CICs), focusing on efforts to
              integrate complex human-machine systems under the exigencies of war. As
              developed and utilized during the war, the CIC was primarily an information
              station, established to collect, evaluate, and disseminate tactical information
              to task force commanders and ships' commanding officers. How best to organize
              the equipment and specially-trained personnel that together made up a CIC was a
              problem of enormous complexity. By studying the Navy's efforts to solve this
              problem, the project seeks to explain how the evolving relationship between
              humans and machines altered warfare at sea. The principal research method for
              the project involves traveling to official archives in order to view official
              and unofficial documents (e.g., letters, memoranda, reports, etc.) produced
              during the time period under investigation and related to the topic under
              investigation. This process is time consuming and requires a physical presence
              at relevant archives, frequently for several weeks at a time. For this project,
              the majority of archival documents are located within the greater Washington DC
              area.
