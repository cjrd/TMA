              Engineering - Other (59)
The project adapts and implements the studio-learning
              approach to undergraduate education that has been developed by the Rennselaer
              Polytechnic Institute (RPI). NJIT understands that a research university must
              offer an undergraduate experience that incorporates active learning and
              promotes critical thinking among students. Studio courses integrate the
              traditional lecture/recitation/laboratory into studio sessions in which faculty
              serve as mentors for students engaged in scaffolded exercises. The RPI approach
              has been successfully adapted at other universities in physics, chemistry,
              mathematics, and introductory engineering. Evaluations have shown that studio
              learning increases student retention of the subject material, improves student
              and faculty satisfaction, builds scholarly communities among students, and
              engages them in active discovery. NJIT's piloting of two introductory courses
              in 2000-2001 demonstrated the potential of studio courses in biomedical
              engineering. This proposal is matched with funding from the Whitaker Foundation
              and from the New Jersey Commission on Higher Education. These funds enable NJIT
              to design and equip a studio classroom. Activities specific to this grant
              include the adaptation of RPI's studio method and the conversion of three
              introductory biomedical engineering courses to studio courses. The project also
              integrates technology into these studio courses. Project outcomes are going to
              be validated through external evaluation. A comprehensive dissemination program
              is being used to support faculty, student, and K-12 teacher development.
