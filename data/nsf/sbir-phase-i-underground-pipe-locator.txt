              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of using magnetic tensor gradiometry to both locate and
              determine the depth of  buried underground and/or submerged underwater ferrous
              pipes.  Detection and location of subsurface pipes is of great importance to
              the utility, natural gas, and petroleum industries.  Existing techniques such
              as Ground Penetrating Radar suffer from a number of limitations, including the
              inability to accurately scan through multi-component soil and water.  This
              technique uses passive magnetic gradiometry to detect underground and
              underwater ferrous pipes, and is unaffected by the presence of water. 
              Commercial magnetometer-based pipe locators do not measure enough component of
              the magnetic field and the magnetic gradient to be able to correctly find the
              depth of the buried pipe.  During Phase I, the feasibility of detecting and
              locating one ferrous pipe in the presence of other ferrous pipes in the
              vicinity will be studied.

A magnetic tensor gradiometer based pipe locator
              will first find applications in the natural gas, petroleum, and the utility
              industries.  In addition, the gradiometer could be easily adapted to find
              underground structures, underwater vehicles, buried current-carrying
              conductors, buried unexploded ordnance and mines and concealed weapons.
