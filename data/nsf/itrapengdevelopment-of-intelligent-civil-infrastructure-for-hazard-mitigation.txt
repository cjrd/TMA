              Modern buildings and structures equipped with embedded control technology can
              dramatically increase structural and occupant safety during earthquake or other
              hazardous load conditions.  Recent progress in wireless communications and
              embedded systems can potentially eliminate the main impediments faced in
              developing such intelligent structural systems.  In the proposed research, a
              new class of semi-active devices will be developed, along ith an analytical
              framework for their optimal design and operation, using specially designed
              embedded chips that will lead to significant benefits regarding the cost of
              maintenance and installation, as well as reliability.  Testing and
              demonstration of the proposed approach with a large-scaled building model on a
              shaking table will also be conducted.  The breath of this multi-disciplinary
              research project (PI's from Mechanical, Civil, Electrical and Computer
              Engineering) provides a unique opportunity for training of students that can
              bridge several critical fields, with eventual development of curriculum modules
              for long-term educational impact.
