              The National Science Foundation has funded several comprehensive multi-user
              databases on the attributes of judges who have served on the U.S. Courts of
              Appeals and District Courts.  No precise analog exists for the U.S.  Supreme
              Court.  The only existing electronic database on justices of the Supreme Court
              (United States Supreme Court Justices Biographical Data, 1789-1958) does not
              include any justices appointed or nominated after 1958 and, owing to various
              other limitations, is far less informative and useful to researchers than the
              existing lower court data bases.

The proposal fills this void by creating a
              multi-user, public database containing a wealth of information on individuals
              nominated (whether confirmed or not) to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Specifically,
              the database will include 238 variables, falling roughly into 5 categories:
              identifiers, background characteristics and personal attributes, nominations,
              service on the Court, and departures from the bench.  The PI's will announce
              its completion on pertinent listservs, archive it with the ICPSR, as well as on
              various web sites.  It will be available in multiple electronic forms (as SPSS,
              Stata, ASCII, and Excel files) and in several formats (one, largely alpha; the
              other, largely numeric) thereby increasing its accessibility to scholarly,
              policy, and journalistic communities.
