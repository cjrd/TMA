              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Development of alternative clustering methods for genomic expression analysis
              and characterization of coregulated genes in yeast."  This project is
              developing fuzzy k-means clustering for analysis of genomic expression data,
              with the goal of identifying coregulated yeast genes that are not identified by
              traditional methods.  After identifying sets of coregulated genes, multiple
              algorithms will be applied to identify sequence motifs that contribute to the
              regulation of expression.
