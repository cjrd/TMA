              EIA-0219627 Craig Douglas University of Kentucky Collaborative Research: 
              ITR/AP-Predictive Contaminant Tracking Using Dynamic Data Driven Application
              Simulation \(DDDAS\) Techniques

This project will lead to a leap-ahead
              technology in simulation capabilities.  Research in the development of new
              methods and algorithms for the specific application areas is needed.  The
              dynamic application requirements will dictate computing systems' support that
              includes systems' software technologies, such as active middleware services for
              real time, dynamic reconfiguration capabilities, resource discovery, load
              balancing, security, fault tolerance, quality of service, and dynamic
              interfaces with field measurement systems.   

An encoded web stream set of
              contaminations from actual situations (both above ground and underground) will
              allow researchers besides us to tap into our virtual reality DDDAS environment.
               Visualization systems will allow us to work with a variety of real networks,
              sensors, and environments.
