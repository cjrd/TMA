              0115851  Field  The objective of this research project is to develop a
              denitrification bioreactor using H2S as the main electron donor for the
              simultaneous removal of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur from refinery condensates. 
              The denitrifying bioreactor will be the first stage of a two-stage biological
              process followed by a nitrification reactor, supplying nitrate via effluent
              recirculation. Under the joint NSF-CONACyT program, this project forms part of
              an international collaboration with the Mexican Institute of Petroleum (IMP)
              and the scientific research funded by this grant will provide a basis for the
              IMP to develop the proposed technology.  This research is needed due to the
              complex microbial ecology of the system.  This research will characterize the
              microbial consortium in the condensate-fed denitrifying bioreactor. 
              Subsequently, the strategies of controlling the reactor to maximize the removal
              of sulfide, phenols and nitrogen will be identified.  The effect of phenols on
              the autotrophic denitrification process will be studied.  An important aspect
              of the research will be to control the oxidation of sulfide to form insoluble
              elemental sulfur, instead of complete oxidation to sulfate, so that it can be
              physically separated for reuse. ***
