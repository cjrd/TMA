The viability for using
              molecular magnets as qubits, the processing elements of quantum computers by
              using pulsed microwave and millimeter-wave radiation to perform quantum
              operations on the spin states of these systems are being investigated.  In the
              process, some important issues regarding the tunneling mechanism by which the
              magnetic moments of these systems reverse direction at temperatures below a few
              Kelvin are also investigated.

A series of experiments are being performed to
              measure the effect of the applied radiation on the magnetic relaxation of the
              molecular magnets. These experiments include photon-assisted relaxation, which
              occurs when the radiation helps the molecule's spin reverse direction, Rabi
              oscillations of the probability of reversal with radiation-pulse duration, and
              free-precession of a quantum superposition of spin states produced by a series
              of radiation pulses.  These experiments are aimed at providing a measure of the
              decoherence time of the excited spin state, a crucial parameter for determining
              whether the molecular magnets can be used as qubits.  The project is also
              investigating methods of mitigating inhomogeneous broadening effects due to
              dipole interactions with neighboring molecules, nuclear spins and
              defects.

The project has potential impacts for the fields of quantum
              computation and information storage. It is also promoting the education of
              undergraduate students, especially underrepresented groups like women and
              minorities.
