              This research program will test current theories and models of the radiation
              belts by comparing the theoretical and model results with observational data
              obtained from the NASA Polar satellite and the GPS satellites.  It will develop
              statistical descriptions of the particle pitch angle distributions for
              different L-shells and different local times as a function of the phase of a
              magnetic storm.  This will make it possible to distinguish among competing
              theories for the transport and loss of relativistic electrons.  It will also
              determine which mechanisms dominate the transport and loss processes under
              different conditions.  In addition, the project will develop time-dependent
              phase space density profiles for the events selected for study in the Geospace
              Environment Modeling campaign on the inner magnetosphere and magnetic storms. 
              These profiles will be made available to the space physics community to help
              establish an understanding of when and where relativistic electron acceleration
              is occurring.  The profiles will also be useful in constraining the theoretical
              work currently being done.
