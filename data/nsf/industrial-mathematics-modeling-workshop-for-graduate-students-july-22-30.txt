              The 2002 NCSU Industrial Mathematics Modeling Workshop for graduate students
              (IMMW2002) is designed to expose students in mathematics, statistics and
              engineering to problems from industry and government laboratories, and
              introduce them to a team approach to problem solving.  The workshop is
              scheduled for the time period July 22, 2002 to July 30, 2002 and is organized
              by Pierre Gremaud, Zhilin Li, Ralph Smith, and Hien Tran.  The workshop
              accommodates approximately 36 graduate students (for a total of 6 teams)
from
              national and international institutions.  Scientists from industry or
              government laboratories will be invited to present current research problems
              and lead teams of 6-7 students through model formulation and at least partial
              solution of the problems.  This enriches the traditional graduate experience
              and provides valuable training for both students considering academic careers
              and those students preparing for noncademic careers.  For students preparing
              for an academic career, the workshop provides experience which will
              significantly broaden their perspective in the classroom and may provide a
              catalyst for later research.  The experience is even more significant for
              students pursuing nonacademic careers since it provides them with
an exposure
              to important ``real life'' problems and gives them some initial experience at
              addressing such problems.
