Potassium-bearing micas and amphiboles are
              widely used in 40Ar/39Ar age studies to determine thermochronologic histories
              and are recognized to have ages that reflect temperature, although the actual
              mechanism(s) and controls are neither well understood nor well documented. 
              This research will investigate the factors governing Ar retention and 40Ar/39Ar
              ages of mica and amphibole in slowly-cooled terranes.  Relationships in
              specimens from the Adirondack Lowlands of New York will be studied.  The
              research will test the often-assumed volume diffusion control of argon loss,
              while also seeking to evaluate alternative mechanisms and factors governing
              argon retention and ages of individual mica and amphibole crystals.  Specific
              objectives of the research are to clarify: (1) the mechanism(s) of argon loss
              in nature and the question of volume-diffusion control on argon retention and
              closure, with specific examination of the roles of stress and fluids (in
              addition to temperature); (2) the crystal-chemical dependence of retention; and
              (3) the roles of microstructures and other factors.  The research will involve
              an array of modern microanalytical techniques on individual crystals,
              including: 40Ar/39Ar and Rb/Sr geochronology, featuring UV laser-ablation Ar
              microanalysis; chemical microanalysis; transmission electron microscopy for
              elucidation of microtextures; X-ray diffraction determination of crystal
              structures; and, analyses of O and H isotopes.  This research targets the next
              level of understanding of these mineral ages and, thus, their use in
              interpreting, deciphering, and refining crustal histories.
