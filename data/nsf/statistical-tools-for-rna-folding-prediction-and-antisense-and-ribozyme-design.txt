	The long-term goal of this project is to develop statistical
              methods and software for improved prediction of RNA secondary structure, and
              for improved computational design of antisense oligonucleotides (oligos) and
              trans-cleaving ribozymes as the vehicles for high-throughput functional
              genomics and drug target validation in the post-genomic era. The objectives of
              the project include: 1) development of statistical algorithms and methodology
              for the rational design of antisense oligos and ribozymes; 2) experimental
              testing and improvement of antisense design method with experimental feedback
              data; 3) development of a statistical RNA folding software Sfold for RNA
              folding prediction and design of antisense oligos and ribozymes; and
              establishment and maintenance of a Sfold Web server for RNA folding and
              antisense oligo and ribozyme design. The Web server will be freely accessible
              by the scientific community for non-commercial applications. 			
	Of the
              estimated 30,000-40,000 genes in the human genome, definitive functions have
              been assigned to only a few percent. Through gene down-regulation, antisense
              oligos and ribozymes are important tools for the assignment of gene functions
              and for the validation of human therapeutic targets. There is compelling
              experimental evidence that the accessibility of the messenger or viral RNA by
              antisense oligos or ribozymes is most constrained by the secondary structure of
              the target. Recently, statistical approaches to the prediction of RNA secondary
              structure and antisense targets have shown promise and advantages over
              established methods. It is thus important to explore fully the advantages of
              statistical approaches to RNA folding prediction and antisense oligo and
              ribozyme design. It is expected that the methods and software developed from
              this project will be widely used for functional genomics applications. This
