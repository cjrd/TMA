With support through the Major Research Instrumentation
              Program, the imaging and analytical capabilities of a
              scanning-electron-microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray
              analytical system and a cathodoluminescence-imaging system will be applied to a
              wide range of natural and synthetic materials in the physical sciences at
              California State University Northridge (CSUN). Initial research use of this
              instrumentation will include the study of biotic and abiotic formation of
              lacustrine carbonate sediment and rocks; diagenesis of siliceous and
              siliciclastic deep-sea sediment; the identification of volcanic, carbonate, and
              carbonaceous phases for radiometric dating; the provenance of volcanic rocks in
              support of tectonic reconstruction in southern California; and the physical
              properties of metals, semiconductor and dielectric thin films. Acquisition of a
              research-quality SEM-EDS will allow faculty to expand existing research
              programs and to explore new avenues of collaborative research. It also will
              enhance recruitment of high-quality graduate and undergraduate students to the
              physical sciences at CSUN and provide them with first-rate research training to
              assure their success in future academic study and professional careers.
