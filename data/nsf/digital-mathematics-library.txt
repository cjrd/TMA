              In this project a working group of stakeholders are meeting several times over a
              twelve-month period to plan a scalable digitization and digital library project
              aimed at "capturing" the intellectual capital of "Twenty Centuries of
              Mathematics". The Cornell University Library is serving as the coordinator of
              this group. Participants in this activity are considering the key issues and
              challenges and recommending strategies to inform a coordinated effort to
              perform a retrospective digitization of the literature of mathematical
              sciences. The resulting digital collection is to serve as an international
              resource for researchers, scientists, faculty, and students, providing access
              to a large body of historical materials that originally appeared in print form.
              This project facilitates cooperation and coordination among a number of
              currently uncorrelated digitization projects in mathematics that have emerged
              at separate institutions and organizations in the U.S. and several other
              countries. Coordination of these different efforts promises to promote a
              systematic approach to digital preservation of mathematical sciences materials,
              and provide users with an integrated means of accessing them.  Given the deep
              connection of this project to the needs of the research community of
              mathematical scientists, the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences is providing
              co-funding for this project.
