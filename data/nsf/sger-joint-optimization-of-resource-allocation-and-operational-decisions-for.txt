              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will focus on the manufacture
              of integrated circuits (ICs) and the provision of air travel as the central
              examples of such manufacturing and service industries. The goal is to develop
              mathematical models that provide a basis for determining how to allocate scarce
              resources among a variety of possible methods available to improve yield. 
              Among the key questions to be  addressed are:  (1) How do different
              yield-altering interventions affect the parameters of the yield distribution? 
              (2) How are operational decisions affected by changes in yield distributions? 
              (3) Under which stochastic and/or parametric orders of yield distributions does
              a company benefit economically?  (4) How can the magnitude of this benefit be
              quantified?   These questions will be answered  using techniques from
              operations research, including Markov decision processes,
              stochastic/variability orderings, and stochastic programming.  The increasing
              complexity of production processes and the ability to create and manage a large
              number of market segments in service industries have served to elevate the
              importance of yield management to manufacturers and service providers
              alike.

There is an extensive body of literature dealing with mathematical
              models necessary to make production-inventory decisions in the manufacturing
              context, or analogously, to decide how much capacity to make available in a
              particular fare-class, or how much to overbook, in the service industry
              context.  This research will provide a bridge between two disparate bodies of
              literature by developing common models to evaluate yield-altering
              interventions.
