This award provides partial support for graduate
              students, 
postdoctoral researchers, junior faculty, and principal speakers to
              
attend the "Symplectic Geometry and Lefschetz pencils" conference to 
be
              held April 12-16, 2001 on the campus of the University of 
California at
              Irvine. This conference will bring together researchers 
to discuss and
              present new advances in the study of symplectic 
Lefschetz theory and
              symplectic 4-manifolds . The  discovery of 
Donaldson that every symplectic
              4-manifold supports a symplectic 
Lefschetz pencil  and the discovery of 
              Auroux and Katzarkov that 
every   symplectic 4-manifold is a finite ramified
              covering of the 
complex projective plane presents the possibility to classify
              
four-dimensional symplectic manifolds  using  mapping class group 
data and
              methods from algebraic geometry. This conference will 
provide an opportunity
              to summarize, centralize and disseminate 
results in this new direction of
              mathematical research and will 
provide the opportunity for new PHD's and
              graduate students in 
algebraic and differential geometry/topology and
              theoretical physics 
to learn from the leaders of this emerging field.
