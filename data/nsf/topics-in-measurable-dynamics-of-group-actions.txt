              The research proposed lies at the interface between measurable
and topological
              dynamics. In these and other areas of dynamics
the problems  concerning the
              relationship between the dynamical
and cohomological properties of systems
              proved to be very
important. One circle of the proposed problems can
              be
informally called "inverse problems for coboundaries", and,
roughly
              speaking, is aimed to understand how and to what extent
the dynamics of a
              measurable group action can be recovered
from the cohomological information,
              and in particular, from the
collection of all measurable coboundaries. It
              turns out that,
in the case of group actions, the algebraic properties of
              the
acting group play an important role. Another line of the
proposed
              research is an attempt to get a complete understanding
of the possibility of
              constructing minimal topological models
for arbitrary families of measurable
              dynamical systems.
In the case when the family consists of one single
              ergodic
automorphism, the answer is given by the famous
              Jewett-Krieger
theorem.

The classical theory of dynamical systems
              originated with the
study of qualitative behavior of the solutions of
              differential
equations describing the motion of a mechanical system.
              The
fundamental theorem of Liouville provided the bridge between
the
              classical theory and modern measurable dynamics. The study
of the connections
              between the different and seemingly
unrelated properties of the measurable
              systems, as well as
relations between the measurable and continuous structures
              in
dynamics, strengthens our sense of connectedness of the entire
building of
              mathematics.
