              9733542  Goetz  Cell adhesion is at the center of a variety of physiological 
              and pathophysiological processes.  An understanding of the  basic mechanisms of
              cell adhesion has led and will continue  to lead to novel medical therapies and
              technologies.  Specific research aims of this career program are to:  (1) 
              systematically study the parameters which govern cell  adhesion under flow
              using leukocyte adhesion molecule coated  microspheres; and (2) generate and
              characterize integrin  coated microspheres.  The research program is to be used
              to  train engineers and biologists in a better understanding of  living
              systems.  In addition,an undergraduate/graduate level  course in the topic of
              cell adhesion is to be initiated.  ***
