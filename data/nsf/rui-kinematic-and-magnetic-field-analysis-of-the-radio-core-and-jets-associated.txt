Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are the most
              energetic regions of the universe and are associated with supermassive black
              holes. As tidal forces disrupt neighboring stars and clouds in these galaxies,
              some of this material, through currently unexplained
magnetic collimation
              effects, is directed into two bipolar relativistic jets.  This project will
              increase our understanding of the kinematic and magnetic field structure of
              these jets.  The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) will be used to create total
              intensity, polarized intensity, fractional polarization, spectral index, and
              rotation measure maps from data for four sources at a number of epochs. An
              attempt will be made to obtain qualitative circular polarization maps, a new
              aspect of parsec-scale imaging of AGN. These images will be used to model and
              determine physical quantities (e.g., shock compression in planar shocks
              associated with BL Lac objects.)  The research will be performed at Sweet Briar
              College, an undergraduate women's college in central Virginia, and will involve
              a total of four students over two summers.
