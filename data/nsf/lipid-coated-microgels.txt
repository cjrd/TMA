              This research explores the preparation and study of new microstructures based on
              stimuli-responsive hydrogels that are coated with a lipid membraned and
              fabricated within a microfluidic channel.  The lipid coating provides a thin
              permeability barrier and the hydrogel network serves as dynamic scaffolding. 
              These soft microstructures can be used to regulate the flow of fluids in
              microfluidic devices without external intervention, and they may serve as
              models of cell and tissue surfaces.  Harnessing their potential requires the
              development of new hydrogels as well as a deeper understanding of the assembly
              of lipid coatings at the gel-liquid interface.  The major objectives of this
              project are: (1) to develop methods for fabricating lipid-coated microgels, (2)
              to characterize the structure and study the transport properties of the lipid
              coating, and (3) to study changed in the permeability of the lipid membrane
              induced by specific chemical or biological agents.  The main methods to be
              employed are the design and synthesis of new monomers and reactive lipids,
              microfabrication and photopolymerization, chemical modification of hydrogels,
              and a variety of scanning confocal microscopy, and electrical
              measurements.

The understanding gained from these studies will help to
              lay the foundation for the long-term objective of fabricating artificial cells,
              and the research undertaken will provide interdisciplinary training to students
              and postdoctoral associates in polymer chemistry and materials science.
