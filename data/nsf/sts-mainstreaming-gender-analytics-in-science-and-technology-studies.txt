Mainstreaming Gender
              Analytics in Science and Technology Studies

With a Small Grant for Training
              and Research, the Science, Medicine, and Technology in Culture (SMTC) program
              at Penn State supports sustained research and graduate student training focused
              on mainstreaming gender analysis in STS.  SMTC at Penn State already has a
              strong gender studies focus; this proposal requests funds to reconfigure that
              focus in ways that facilitate training a cohort of graduate students in a new
              generation of interdisciplinary gender analytics.   With this award, Penn State
              is poised to further research, teaching, and intervention in these areas.  This
              project investigates how both working scientists and scholars in the field of
              STS understand how gender structures the personnel, methodologies, and results
              of science.  The SMTC program includes a graduate course that makes gender
              analysis a foundational methodology to all fields of STS, examining how it
              might apply to areas even where sexual dimorphisms (both biological and
              cultural) are not immediately present.  Three research applications are
              highlighted, one in each year of the award: 1) human origins research, 2)
              colonial science, and 3) the cultural production of ignorance.  The award
              allows SMTC to support three graduate students per year for three years, a
              one-time workshop, and a two-year post-doctoral student.  Course developments
              are to be disseminated to the STS community in article form, through sessions
              sponsored by the Committees on Education of the History of Science Society,
              Society for Social Studies of Science,  Society for the History of Technology,
              and Society for Literature and Science at their annual meetings, and as part of
              the HSS Syllabus Samplers and similar organs.  Additional outcomes include two
              edited volumes: one drawn from a lecture series that will explore applying
              gender analysis to central research fields in STS, and one drawn from the
              workshop on how gender analysis is changing various aspects of the natural
              sciences.
