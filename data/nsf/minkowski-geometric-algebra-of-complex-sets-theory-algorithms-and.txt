Minkowski geometric
              algebra is concerned with the complex sets populated by the sums and products
              of all pairs of complex numbers drawn from given complex Cset operands.Whereas
              the Minkowski sum under vector addition in R n has been thoroughly studied,from
              both the theoretical and computational
perspective,the Minkowski product in R
              2 induced by the multiplication rule for complex numbers is a relatively
              unexplored oncept.
Conceptually, Minkowski geometric algebra is the natural
              generalization of real interval arithmetic to complex Cnumber sets.With the
              transition from real to complex,however,the trivial geometry of real intervals
              and their consequent closure under addition and multiplication is relinquished.
               The
two Cdimensional haracter of Minkowski geometric algebra endows it with a
              rich geometrical ontent,in which simple operands (e.g.,circular disks) yield
              subtle results described by analytic curves such as the Cartesian oval ovals of
              Cassini and their higher Corder generalizations,while sophisticated algorithms
              are required to approximate Minkowski combinations for general sets.Apart from
              being a basic tool to monitor the propagation of uncertainty in complex
              Cvariable computations,the algebra o .ers a versatile language for
two
              Cdimensional shape operators and the description of (direct or inverse)
              wavefront re .ection/refraction problems in optics.It is also fundamental to
              the stability analysis of systems with uncertain parameters,in the context of
              the Routh CHurwitz criterion and the Kharitonov robustness theorem.
