              This award supports a conference on Environmental and Physiological Integration
              of Long-Distance Transport Processes in Plants, to be held at the Harvard
              Forest, Petersham, MA in October 2002.  The goal of this conference will be to
              review and synthesize new ideas and insights in the area of long distance
              transport in plants, emphasizing both the biophysics of transport through the
              xylem and phloem and the emerging area exploring interactions between the two. 
              In the past, xylem transport has been viewed largely in terms of physical
              processes, while movement in the phloem has been studied primarily with
              reference to membrane transport and osmotic regulation.  There is now greater
              appreciation for the role of living cells and biochemical processes in the
              xylem, as well as the need to understand the hydraulic components involved in
              carbohydrate movement.  Thus, the time is ripe for a conference that brings
              together these two converging areas and explores the ways in which these two
              pathways influence each other.  The funds provided by this award will support
              the participation (travel and housing) of a diverse group of scientists,
              including women and scientists early in their research careers.  Vascular
              transport plays an important role in understanding both how plants respond to
              drought and the mechanisms by which they control patterns of carbon allocation
              required for growth.  By bringing together individuals with expertise in
              long-distance transport processes, we believe that this conference and the
              resulting proceedings (to be published as a book by Academic Press) will have
              lasting value by virtue of stimulating new insights, revealing new research
              opportunities and opening the door for new collaborative efforts.
