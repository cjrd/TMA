              The U.S. National Committee for Rock Mechanics (USNC/RM) is the focal point for
              rock mechanics and other geotechnical activities within the National Research
              Council (NRC), and operates under the auspices of the NRC's Board on Earth
              Sciences and Resources (BESR). The Board on Earth Sciences and Resources is
              considering whether there is a need for modification to the name and task
              statement for the USNC/RM.  Consultations with sponsoring agencies and the
              community are continuing, with the expectation that a committee with a broader
              scope and task statement will be in existence by the end of 2001.  There is an
              expectation that a more broadly-based committee will encompass the full range
              of geological and geotechnical engineering disciplines, and that the new
              committee will concentrate to a greater extent on producing advisory studies
              and reports at the request of federal agencies.  This proposal is seeking
              support for this wide-ranging consultation process.
