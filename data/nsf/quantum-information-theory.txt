This project
              is concerned with a number of mathematical problems
which arise when quantum
              particles are used to process and/or
transmit information.   The P.I. plans to
              continue the analysis 
and refinement of models of noise; these are important
              in both
quantum communication and error analysis in quantum computation. 
              
Work in quantum communication includes a proposal which may resolve
the
              long-standing question of whether or not entangled inputs can
enhance the
              capacity of quantum channels to transmit classical
information.   The P.I.
              also plans to construct new classes of error
correcting codes as prototypes
              for codes which can be designed 
to deal with those errors to which a
              particular implementation 
of quantum computation is most vulnerable.  Such
              codes could
be combined with other techniques to reduced the overall
              code
length.   The P.I. will also consider a random Hamiltonian
approach to
              the analysis of the efficiency of a proposed scheme
for adiabatic quantum
              computation.   Finally, the P.I. plans to
continue the study of metrics in
              information geometry, and their
connection to measures of purity, relative
              entropy, and distances
between states.

It has now been established that
              quantum particles have the potential
to provide the basis for vastly more
              powerful computers, and new methods
of secure communication.  Although
              building quantum computers remains
a formidable experimental challenge, the
              feasibility of several methods
of quantum communication and encryption have
              already been convincingly
demonstrated.   However, it is also clear that all
              practical 
instrumentation is imperfect and subject to noise and errors.
This
              is not surprising; dealing with noise has long been an important
facet of
              classical communication.   However, quantum information devices
are subject to
              a much larger and more complex variety of errors arising
from noise.   This
              gives rise to new mathematical challenges.   This
proposal deals with a number
              of these questions.   Effective methods
of dealing with noise are essential to
              the success of the nation's
ability to exploit the power of quantum theory for
              next generation of
computers and cryptographic protocols.
