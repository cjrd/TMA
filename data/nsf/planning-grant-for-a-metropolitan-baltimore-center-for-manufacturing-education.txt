              To address the shortage of well-educated, skilled workers in the manufacturing
              sector, and maintain economic competitiveness in the region, the Community
              College of Baltimore County (CCBC), in cooperation with partners representing
              industry, education and government, is planning for a Metropolitan Baltimore
              Center for Manufacturing Education. The Center has as its main thrusts
              reengineering the CCBC manufacturing programs; expansion of current cooperative
              arrangements among manufacturing stakeholders; adaptation, adoption or
              development of curriculum; increasing enrollment capacity; and increasing
              graduation and placement of technicians into skilled positions within regional
              manufacturing. To plan for a Metropolitan Baltimore Center for Manufacturing
              Education, the CCBC is bringing together all shareholders in manufacturing to
              develop a plan of action building on existing programs and industry need;
              establishing a management plan for the Center; enhancing collaboration among
              the partners; identifying deliverables; and developing a plan for
              evaluation.
