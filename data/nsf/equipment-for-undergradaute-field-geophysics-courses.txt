              Geology (42)
The Department of Geology at Kansas State University is obtaining
              several exploration geophysics instruments, including a differential global
              positioning system, gravimeter, and ground penetrating radar system, in order
              to build an undergraduate field geophysics teaching program adapted from the
              successful SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) program led by the
              Los Alamos National Laboratory. The instruments are also enhancing our existing
              teacher education program. During the past two years, the department has made a
              commitment to improving its undergraduate geophysics curriculum by increasing
              the number of geophysics courses from one to five, and by increasing the number
              of geophysics faculty from zero to two. The geophysical equipment is being
              integrated into introduction to geophysics, field geophysics, hydrogeology,
              exploration geophysics, field methods, field camp, and introductory geology for
              education majors. The field geophysics course is taking advantage of a local
              field site, the Big Blue River valley, and students are mapping the subsurface
              geology using a variety of geophysical techniques.
