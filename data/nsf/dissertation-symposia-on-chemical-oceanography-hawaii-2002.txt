OCE-0224374


Under this award, the American Institute of
              Biological Sciences will continue its management of the Dissertation Symposia
              on Chemical Oceanography (DISCO), which it has run under joint NSF/ONR/NOAA
              sponsorship since 1978.  From the time of its inception twenty-four years ago,
              the objectives of DISCO have been (1) to bring together in a common forum
              recent doctoral recipients in chemical oceanography to discuss their
              cutting-edge dissertation research and (2) to encourage the formation of
              long-term scientific collaborative relationships early in their professional
              lives.  DISCO has been a resounding success -- so much so that the enthusiastic
              publicity generated in the academic community led to DISCO becoming the de
              facto gold standard that led to the organization of other DISCO-like
              dissertation symposia in other branches of the earth sciences.
