              Two international workshops on Industrial Ecology and Environmentally Benign
              Manufacturing towards Dematerialization are to be held October 2 - 5, 2001 at
              Tokai University in Hawaii.  Two - 2 day sessions will be held in conjunction
              with the International Conference on Ecomaterials (Oct 2-4) with a final day
              dedicated to summarizing results of the meetings and producing a report.  It is
              expected that participants will come from universities, governmental
              organizations, and corporations and trade organizations from around the world. 
              The organizing committee is represented by Japanese universities, industry and
              national laboratories. 

This 2001 ecomaterials conference will be the fifth
              in a series of international conferences that have been sponsored by the
              Japanese.  All previous conferences have taken place in Japan or the Far East. 
              With this conference the founders hope to expand the venue and include American
              and other nationalities to discuss many different aspects of manufacturing,
              design and materials processing and their impact on the environment.
