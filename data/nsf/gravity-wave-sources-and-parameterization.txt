              Gravity waves with periods ranging from minutes to hours are believed to affect
              the atmospheric circulation, temperature, and mixing processes at levels
              extending from the troposphere through the mesosphere and above.  However, they
              are too small to be resolved in general circulation models (GCMs) and must be
              treated via parameterization.  That is, their effects must be described
              approximately for inclusion in large-scale models.  This research program aims
              to quantify the properties of gravity waves and determine their sources, their
              geographic and seasonal variations, and their effects on the atmosphere. 
              Emphasis is on the waves generated by hurricanes and other convective storm
              systems.  The goal is to improve the ways of parameterizing their effects in
              GCMs.  The approach focuses on analysis of aircraft and balloon observations
              from previous field experiments to derive information on the momentum flux and
              the temperature perturbations associated with gravity waves, which information
              is then employed for developing parameterizations.  Collaboration on including
              the parameterizations in GCMs is planned with researchers at the NOAA
              Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and other organizations.  These studies
              will provide a means of both studying the global-scale effects of gravity waves
              and refining the parameterizations.  The goal of the work is to improve
              large-scale atmospheric simulations by approximating more accurately the
              effects of the waves.
