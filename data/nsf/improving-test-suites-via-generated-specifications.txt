  Improving test suites via generated behavioral
              abstractions
  Michael Ernst

Testing is a key to detecting bugs and
              increasing software reliability, but generating good test suites is difficult. 
              This project investigates a novel technique for using behavioral differences to
              improve test suites.  The technique compares dynamically generated behavioral
              abstractions of executions and selects the more complete one -- that is, the
              test suite that exercises more of the program's semantic behavior.  Whereas
              previous automatic techniques compare dynamic (run-time) behavior to the static
              structure and text of the program, this new technique considers behavior, which
              complements structural techniques and is arguably more important.

The
              technique is applied to generating, augmenting, and minimizing test suites. 
              Users provide the program to be tested and a technique for generating test
              cases (via a grammar, random generation, traces collected from users, or
              otherwise).  Users never need to provide a specification.  However, the
              technique generates a behavioral abstraction that is syntactically identical to
              a formal specification and that, after being checked and perhaps augmented by a
              human, can be
used as a specification.  The efficacy of these techniques is
              investigated and improved, and they are applied in substantial case studies.
