              The numerical solution of large, sparse systems of linear equations and
              eigenvalue problems is central to many scientific and engineering applications.
              Iterative methods executed on parallel computers often provide the only means
              of solving these problems. Most parallel implementations of iterative methods
              have adopted a fine grain allocation of equations to different processors.
              However, recent architectural and computational advances suggest that
              fine-grain methods may be inadequate. Specifically, high network latencies and
              synchronization overheads may make fine grain methods ill suited to clusters of
              workstations (COWs) and massively parallel processors (MPPs). In addition,
              partitioning a problem to a large number of processors may lead to load
              imbalances and processor idling. The increasing use of Computational Grids
              consisting of heterogeneous networks only makes these problems worse. Achieving
              high performance requires new levels of sophistication in parallel algorithms
              and in the interaction of the implementation with the runtime system.

This
              project will advance the state of the art in high performance, parallel
              iterative methods by exploring algorithms that combine coarse and fine
              granularity, and dynamic resource utilization schemes. It will build a new
              multigrain implementation level on top of traditional parallelization methods
              to introduce coarser granularity during the preconditioning step. It will
              identify system-aware iterative algorithms and algorithmic patterns that enable
              dynamic load balancing, and use them to exploit available runtime system
              information. The resulting codes will be made available to the community.
