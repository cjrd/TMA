              Networked information systems play an increasingly important role in critical
              infrastructures such as power generation and distribution, transportation,
              commerce, and national security. The continuing spate of security incidents
              reported by organizations such as CERT Coordination Center demonstrates that in
              spite of best efforts in securing systems, "hacker" attacks will penetrate even
              the best defense mechanisms. To cope with such attacks, new techniques need to
              be developed that can detect and respond to such attacks. Unfortunately,
              existing approaches focus primarily on after-the-fact detection of such
              attacks. Moreover, intrusion response relies primarily on human involvement.
              These two factors mean that fast-progressing attacks (e.g., programmed attacks)
              can effect significant damage before any protective response is launched.
              Recovery from such damage is labor-intensive, and will render the target system
              unavailable for hours if not days. This project will develop new approach that
              automates intrusion responses so that the target system can defend itself from
              serious damage due to attacks. It will build on the proposer's successful
              research in specification-based intrusion detection. Key technical components
              of this project include: specification language enhancements to express
              response actions, techniques for isolating compromised processes so that they
              do not interfere with the rest of the system, and deception techniques that can
              provide an illusion of success to attacker while protecting the target the
              system.
