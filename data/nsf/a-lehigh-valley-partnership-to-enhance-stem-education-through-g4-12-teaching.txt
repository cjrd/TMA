              Lehigh University is partnering with middle and high schools in the Allentown
              and Bethlehem Area School Districts in the Lehigh Valley, industry experts from
              Air Products and Chemicals, Agere Systems, Insaco, Inc. and the Discovery
              Center for Science and Technology Pennsylvania on "A Lehigh Valley Partnership
              to Enhance STEM Education Through G4-12 Teaching Fellows."  The involvement of
              industry and the Discovery Center is novel and evidence of the project's 
              intellectual merit.  This project builds upon established outreach programs at
              Lehigh and will continue to enhance the educational experience of students in
              Lehigh Valley schools by placing graduate and advanced undergraduate Teaching
              Fellows in STEM classrooms and establishing STEM outreach teams.  Teaching
              Fellows are helping grade 4-12 teachers introduce inquiry-based learning and
              use multimedia, wireless and other innovative technologies in local classrooms.
              Outreach teams consisting of Fellows, Lehigh faculty and industry experts are
              training and exchanging ideas with STEM teachers and administrators from the
              two schools districts. The great diversity within the school districts served
              promise broad impacts from these activities.  This project is partially
              supported by funds from the Directorate for Engineering and from the
              Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.
