Interleukin-1B (IL-1B) is a potent and pleiotropic
              cytokine produced by glia in the brain which influences many different cell
              types.  When IL-1B interacts with receptors on glia, it activates a specific
              intracellular signaling cascade inducing production of many growth factors and
              cytokines. Specific neuronal populations in the brain, in particular
              hippocampal neurons, also have receptors for IL-1B, however neurons do not
              produce cytokines and growth factors in response to IL-1B.  The distinct signal
              transduction pathways activated by this cytokine determine the functional
              response of different cell types.  In these studies, therefore, we will
              elucidate the different signaling pathways that mediate the actions of IL-1B in
              neurons compared to astrocytes.  In addition, one of the growth factors which
              is induced by IL-1B in glia is nerve growth factor (NGF).  One of the NGF
              receptors (p75) is also induced by IL-1B in glial cells, suggesting that NGF
              has effects on glia distinct from its well-characteristic neurotrophic effects
              on neurons. These studies will investigate the signaling pathways and
              functional consequences of NGF on glial cells.
Growth factors and cytokines
              influence many different cell populations, but induce distinct responses which
              are cell type-specific.  Elucidation of the signal transduction pathways
              activated in neurons and glia by a pleiotropic cytokine such as IL-1B will
              allow insight into how a single factor can activate different signaling events
              and functional consequences in distinct cell types.
