Abstract
Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics
              (Vadstena, 2003): An International Combinatorics Conference 

This award
              funds young mathematicians (graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s) from the
              United States to travel to the fifteenth annual Formal Power Series and
              Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC) international conference, being hosted this
              year by The University of Linkoping, (Sweden), June 23-27, 2003.

This
              continuing series of conferences bring together researchers from various areas
              of combinatorics and theoretical computer science and links them with leading
              scientists from allied disciplines in pure mathematics, applied mathematics,
              bioinformatics, and physics. The focus of the 2003 conference is on algebraic
              and enumerative
combinatorics, again with emphasis on interdisciplinary links
              to allied fields, including this year, for the first time, biology and
              bioinformatics.
