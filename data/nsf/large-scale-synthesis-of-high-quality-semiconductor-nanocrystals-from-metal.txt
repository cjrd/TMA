              The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division supports this award to
              University of Arkansas to study the basic mechanism and method of nanoparticle
              crystal growth using size- and shape-dependent optical properties of these
              nano-particles. With this award, Professor Xiaogang Peng will develop green
              chemistry-based methods for the large scale synthesis of nano-sized cadmium
              selenide crystals from the less toxic precursor cadmium oxide, and these
              methods will be quite different from the presently used methods with precursor
              dimethyl cadmium, which is toxic, unstable and expensive.  The award will help
              to develop new methods for the large-scale synthesis of semiconductor
              nanocrystals of uniform size and shape for applications in electrooptic
              devices. Both graduate and undergraduate students will greatly benefit from the
              training and research opportunities provided by this award in materials
              chemistry.

With this award, nanoparticle crystal growth will be studied
              using size- and shape-dependent optical properties of these crystals.  
              Nano-sized cadmium selenide crystal will be prepared in large scale using
              cadmium oxide as the precursor.  This green chemistry-based method will be cost
              effective, and used less toxic and much more stable precursor. Both graduate
              and undergraduate students will greatly benefit from the training and research
              opportunities provided by this award in nano-crystal growth and
              characterization.
