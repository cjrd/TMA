              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will research
              passive components in electronic circuits increases, new interconnect
              technologies, such as embedded passives, are under development to optimize
              utilization of board real estate. For embedded passives, dimensional accuracy
              translates into control over component values, and so there is a need for
              high-precision fabrication processes. TPL has developed soft lithography
              micro-contact printing, an additive process that can fabricate near-net-shape
              structures with features between 100 microns and the sub-micron scale. The
              innovation exploits the compositional flexibility of sol-gel chemistry to
              synthesize powder-free inks with a wide range of materials properties that can
              be patterned with high resolution using the novel micro-contact printing
              technology. 

Potential commercial applications effort will demonstrate the
              feasibility of micro-contact printing for application to high-density
              interconnects solutions, and could be an enabling technology for high-precision
              embedded passives. The PI has pioneered the use of micro-contact printing as a
              novel interconnect technology while TPL has extensive experience in developing
              packaging solutions for the electronics industry.
