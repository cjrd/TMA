              This CAREER award will fund a project whose goal is the development of a better
              understanding of the fundamental mechanism of self-organizing behavior at
              surfaces and the significance of interfacial stress, through direct dynamic
              measurements of the driving forces of self-assembly using scanning tunneling
              microscopy (STM). Two-dimensional nano-arrays in thermal equilibrium of
              large-scale order and size uniformity will be grown on strained interfaces
              between a bimetallic atomic layer and a dissimilar substrate in ultrahigh
              vacuum. Combining the structural information (from unique real-time
              variable-temperature STM measurements) with quantum-size effects in the
              electronic structure (from high-resolution UV photoemission) will guide the
              development of new dynamic models to describe the evolution and properties of
              nanoscale structures on surfaces. This research will form an integral part of
              the proposed educational outreach program. The newly designed course entitled
              "Modern Aspects of Materials Physics for High School Teachers" and the proposed
              "Summer Materials Science Institute for High School Students" will address the
              need to improve the science achievement for students by enriching science
              teaching in the high school classroom.  In addition the graduate and
              undergraduate students involved in this research will receive training in state
              of the art techniques, providing them with a sound basis for their future
              scientific careers.

Spontaneous formation of organized nanoscale structures
              on surfaces has been observed in many systems. They are thought to arise
              because of a delicate balance between long-range strain field interactions and
              short-range chemical forces that stabilizes these structures. A detailed
              understanding of the driving forces, however, does not exist. The goal of this
              CAREER project is to identify and control these interactions that have the
              potential to surpass standard patterning technologies and thus, to lead the way
              to higher density magnetic storage, more selective catalytic materials, higher
              sensitivity chemical sensors, and perhaps, quantum computers. Unique real-time
              measurements of the dynamics of individual atoms self-ordering into nano-arrays
              will be performed on a home-built (scanning tunneling) microscope. The results
              will guide the development of new dynamic models to describe the evolution of
              nanoscale structures on surfaces. This research will form an integral part of
              the proposed educational outreach program. The newly designed course entitled
              "Modern Aspects of Materials Physics for High School Teachers" and the proposed
              "Summer Materials Science Institute for High School Students" will address the
              need to improve the science achievement for students by enriching science
              teaching in the high school classroom.  In addition the graduate and
              undergraduate students involved in this research will receive training in state
