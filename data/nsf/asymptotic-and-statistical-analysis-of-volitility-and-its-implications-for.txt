Asymptotic and Statistical Analysis of Volatility and its Implications
for Derivative Pricing and Risk Management

In modern financial markets, investors are increasingly faced with
exposure to changing and uncertain volatility. This project concerns
mathematical models in which volatility is a stochastic process, and
their use in derivative pricing and risk management.  The main aim is
to develop an efficient and robust framework in which models are
calibrated from observable market data and then used to design
risk-minimizing strategies that hedge a portfolio against the
potentially serious consequences of changing volatility. This problem
is important for investors from large trading institutions to
individuals with pension funds.

The spectacular growth in the size of the derivatives market over the
last twenty-five years (currently it has a turnover of trillions of
dollars in the US) plus recent infamous (and equally spectacular) risk
(mis)management disasters, such as the Barings, Orange County and Long
Term Capital Management fiascos, have created an urgent need for smart
mathematical and computational models to quantify the respective risks
and rewards of such investments. This project aims to build on the
methodology introduced by Black, Scholes and Merton, to take into
account the fluctuating nature of market volatility. Mathematical
tools are combined with statistical analysis of past prices to produce
formulas and software that accurately capture the potential losses and
gains in today's vast derivative market.
