	Modeling of InSAR data by the USGS has determined that an uplift
              of ~0.022 km 3 has developed since approximately 1998 due to an inflation
              source at 5-7 km depth. This uplift has not been accompanied by seismic
              activity. A goal of this project is to determine if this uplift is attributable
              to new magma injection, expansion of an existing magma body, or hydrothermal
              processes. If magma injection is producing the uplift, then an important second
              goal will be to characterize the magma chamber. Important questions to be
              addressed are: 1) does the magma chamber at 5-7 km depth contain only material
              added within the past few years? 2) what  is the volume of the magma? 3) is the
              magma basic or silicic? 4) what is the gas content of the magma? These
              questions will be addressed by modeling the proposed gravity
              measurements.
	Three years of gravity observations on three radial profiles of
              the uplift will be completed. Vertical control with leveling and GPS surveys is
              planned by the USGS and will be available to this project. The siting of
              stations and survey schedule will be optimized for the characterization and
              removal of the annual groundwater and soil moisture signal from this data set.
              Central to modeling of the gravity changes is observing the ratio of gravity
              change to vertical uplift at monitored sites, which may be interpreted in terms
              of mass and density change at depth.
