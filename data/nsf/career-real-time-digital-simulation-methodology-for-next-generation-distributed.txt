              The Gas Research Institute predicts that by the year 2030 distributed
              generation, including fuel cells, wind energy converters and micro turbines,
              will capture about 30 % of the energy market. This will result in a
              transformation from a centralized toward a distributed energy system
              infrastructure. It is expected that the proposed research on real time
              simulation methodology will be of significant value for the demonstration of
              the feasibility of this transformation and for key tasks such as research,
              design, analysis, testing of equipment, and protection of the next-generation
              energy systems. The combination of efficient formulation of parallel and
              sequential equation solving, automatic generation and adaptation of numerical
              methods for the diverse characteristics of distributed energy systems, exact
              tracking of power electronic switching, and modular modeling of energy systems
              will constitute the core of the proposed simulation methodology. The critical
              problems of today's electromagnetic transients simulators concerning the
              simulation of diverse waveforms and discontinuities will be solved and dramatic
              improvements of computational accuracy and speed are expected. The research
              results will be integrated in a novel course. To achieve effective teaching and
              learning, the proposer will start new initiatives: support of underrepresented
              minority students, international experience of students, innovative
              interdisciplinary bridging of curricula and communities, industry-guided course
              delivery, and modular research activity decomposition for active undergraduate
              involvement. The proposer expects to reignite student interest in the
              fascinating field of energy systems and make student motivation a decisive
              factor for the success of this project.
