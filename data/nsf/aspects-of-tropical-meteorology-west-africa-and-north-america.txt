              The project will investigate the formation and maintenance of a key component of
              the tropical circulation that affects summer rainfall over continental United
              States: tropical storms, or hurricanes, in the Atlantic. The genesis of
              Atlantic hurricanes, which often make landfall over continental US, is in the
              African easterly waves, and the project will advance understanding of the
              dynamical factors controlling African easterly wave activity. The waves
              themselves are posited to arise from hydrodynamic instability of the African
              easterly jet, and Dr. Chen's research will examine the formation, maintenance,
              and variability of this lower tropospheric jet using the modern reanalysis data
              sets, which provide a wealth of information on circulation and diabatic
              heating. The diagnostic research will provide a new assessment of the dynamic
              and thermodynamic interactions involved in the formation and development of
              African easterly waves, building on the pioneering analyses of Carlson, Burpee,
              and Reed that date back a quarter century.
