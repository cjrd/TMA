     The investigator and his colleagues develop a
              mathematical
framework and fast computational schemes for the
              reconstruction
of functions, signals or images from noisy, very large
              sampled
data sets, acquired on nonuniform grids, by nonideal
              acquisition
devices.  The problem of nonuniform sampling and
              reconstruction
is treated in the context of shift-invariant subspaces,
              Besov
spaces, and in arbitrary dimensions.  The theory is developed for
the
              case when the samples are obtained from weighted averages.
Density conditions
              for exact reconstruction are established.  When
the data are noisy,
              incomplete, or when the assumptions needed
for exact reconstruction are not
              satisfied, bounds on the error
between the reconstructed and original signal
              are derived in
terms of the sampling densities, the averaging functionals,
              and
the noise statistics.  The development of the mathematical
framework and
              the computational schemes requires a new set of
techniques and ideas, and
              involves several areas of mathematics
including wavelet theory, frame theory,
              functional analysis, and
harmonic analysis.
     The project is motivated by
              problems arising in data
transmission, geophysical exploration, astronomy,
              spectroscopy,
and biomedical imaging.  The problem of reconstructing a signal
              or
an image from a set of nonuniform samples is encountered in
              many
applications of signal or image processing.  For example, the loss
of
              data packets during transmission through internet or from
satellites can be
              viewed as a nonuniform sampling and
reconstruction problem.  In geophysical
              exploration, the earth's
magnetic field is measured by a combination of
              airborn, fast
moving acquisition devices, as well as scattered
              stationary
devices resulting in highly nonuniform sampling patterns, and
              a
huge data set.  The goal is to reconstruct the magnetic field and
use it to
              reveal geological features.  In fact, modern digital
data processing of
              signals or images always uses a sampled
version of the original analog signals
              or images.  However, the
sampling devices are never ideal, and the collected
              data consist
of average samples.  Moreover these data are often very
              large,
incomplete, and corrupted by noise.  The question then arises
whether
              and how the original signal can be recovered from the
data.  Therefore the
              investigator aims to 1) quantify the
conditions under which it is possible to
              reconstruct a signal
exactly from different sets of nonuniform
              average-samples; 2) use
these analytical results to develop explicit, and
              computationally
efficient reconstruction schemes; and 3) analyze the
              performance
of the algorithms under adverse conditions, or when the data
              are
incomplete or corrupted by noise.  The development of a theory
              and
algorithms that perform well under stringent and realistic
situations
              will help the analysis, processing and management of
very large data sets
              obtained digitally by new acquisition
modalities, and transmitted or received
              by communication networks
such as the internet, cellular phones, and other
              distributed
communication systems.
