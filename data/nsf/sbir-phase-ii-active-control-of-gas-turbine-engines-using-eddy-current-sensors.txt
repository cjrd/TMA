              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and
              test algorithms for active control of blade vibration and engine stability
              (stall and surge) using an eddy current sensor (ECS) array.   The approach
              utilizes signal analysis and diagnostic tools in active control algorithms for
              the detection of engine faults.  Phase II will extend the functionality of the
              ECS system beyond diagnostics to active and automatic real-time control of gas
              turbine engines.

An ECS array is currently the favored sensor system for
              installation on the Joint Strike Fighter, in which a software system upgrade
              capable of using ECS data to compute the necessary indicators and estimate the
              disturbances needed is desirable for active vibration and engine stability
              control.  It would reduce the number of new sensors needed for active control
              and potentially save millions of dollars.  Large commercial markets are
              indicated in commercial aircraft and gas turbine power plants.
