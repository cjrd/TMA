The purpose of the project
              is to study the properties and applications of
quantum groups, the Yang-Baxter
              equation, graph homology, and similar
constructions in algebra with geometric
              formalism.  In particular the role of
these constructions will be considered
              in two areas:  In 3-dimensional
topology, they arise in the guise of of
              perturbative and non-perturbative
invariants of Chern-Simons field theory. 
              There is a good chance that such
invariants are related to the Thurston
              Geometrization Program, at least for
hyperbolic manifolds.  In quantum
              computation, the same non-perturbative
Chern-Simons field theory produces an
              interesting method for fault tolerance,
one which needs to be developed
              further.

The purpose of the project is to develop and apply certain areas of
              algebra in
which formulas have a geometric structure.  Two famous examples of
              this are a
linear algebra, in which matrices have some geometry, and Feynman
              diagrams,
whose geometry is physically meaningful. Geometrization of algebraic
              formulas
has been influential in enumerative combinatorics, in non-commutative
              algebra,
and in geometric topology in the last 15 years.  One of the first and
              most
important representatives of this recent trend is the Jones polynomial,
              an
invariant of knots.  Although the Jones polynomial arose in algebra
              and
mathematical, it and its generalization are at least as important in
              topology,
and recently also in quantum computation.  These applications of the
              new trend
in algebra will be investigated.
