              This award is for research that will acquire high-resolution Holocene climate
              records for the southwestern USA using isotopic (i.e., oxygen-18 and carbon-13)
              and mineralogical (i.e., microprobe studies of strontium and magnesium)
              analyses of stalagmites formed in caves in Carlsbad Cavern and other caves of
              the Guadalupe Mountains in southeastern New Mexico.  

Stalagmites hold the
              potential for possessing a windfall of high-resolution records of paleoclimate
              because of recent advances in dating speleothems (i.e., cave deposits that
              include stalagmites) using thermal ionization mass spectrometry Uranium-series
              method.  For example, in many cases, banding in speleothems is sufficiently
              uniform and distinct to allow frequency analyses to examine El Nino/Southern
              Oscillation (ENSO) scale variability.  In the southwestern region of the United
              States, compelling evidence exists that changes in precipitation are related to
              changes in El Nino intensity.

The broader impacts of this proposed research
              center on the development of a new archive of paleoclimatic data from
              terrestrial sites.  Success in demonstrating the fidelity of speleothems for
              recording climatic events will dramatically improve our understanding of
              climate.
