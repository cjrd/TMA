Title:
              Studies of the Evolution of Thunderstorm Electricity and Lightning

This
              project continues the analysis of data collected in the summer of 1999 at
              Langmuir Laboratory of New Mexico Tech as part of the SEET project (Study of
              Electrical Evolution of Thunderstorms).  The data consist of thunderstorm
              observations by two research radars, a surface network of electric-field
              measurements, the precise locations and times of lightning flashes measured by
              the Lightning Mapping Array, and balloon-soundings of the electric field in the
              storms.   The objective is to synthesize the data to produce a coherent picture
              of thunderstorm electrical evolution.  The locations of the main charge regions
              are inferred from the balloon soundings of the electric field.  The locations
              and magnitudes of the charges measured in sequential soundings are then
              compared to study the electrical evolution of the cloud.  The locations of the
              charged regions are also compared with the lightning paths and the
              radar-observed precipitation patterns to learn how these quantities are
              related.  The work advances the understanding of charge generation and
              lightning production by thunderstorms, explores the relations between the radar
              structure of storms and the lightning they produce, and lays groundwork for
              better predictions of the electrical hazards that accompany thunderstorms.
