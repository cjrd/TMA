              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at St. Cloud State University  will acquire a
              Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass
              Spectrometer.  This instrument will be used in a wide variety of studies,
              including a) the identification of molecular determinants of cellular
              sensitivity to cytostatic/cytotoxic agents that may be unique to tumor cells;
              b) the identification of genetic polymorphisms in human aldehyde dehydrogenases
              that will render differential cellular sensititivy to cytotoxic agents; c)
              characterization of electroactive polymers; and d) the study of precursor
              molecules used as dopant sources for fluorescent sol-gel glasses.  In addition,
              MALDI MS will be a major component in a new laboratory curriculum for
              biophysical chemistry.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)
              time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry is the technique of choice for obtaining
              accurate molecular weights on molecules up to and over 300,000 daltons, with
              extremely high sensitivity.  Use of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer has therefore
              become a standard technique in most DNA/protein core facilities.  The ability
              to obtain very accurate molecular weights of biological molecules is
              fundamental to all biological and biomedical research and essential in a modern
              research and training environment.  These studies will have an impact in the
              areas of biophysical and materials chemistry.
