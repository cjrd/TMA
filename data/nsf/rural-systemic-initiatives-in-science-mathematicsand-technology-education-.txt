              This project is organized around six Interventions, each with implementation
              strategies targeted at the various administrative and teaching levels. 
              Superintendents, school board members, and principals will participate in
              Leadership Institutes that will enhance the leaders' abilities to support the
              resource, policy, and instructional alignments and revisions necessary to
              accomplish the reform.  Math and science specialists will provide guidance and
              technical assistance in the development and implementation of standards-based
              programs in math and science, and will assist district personnel to review and
              analyze data and other information necessary to gauge progress.  They will work
              with and through the district and school improvement plans, and will help
              develop collaborations with higher education institutions and other reform
              projects.
