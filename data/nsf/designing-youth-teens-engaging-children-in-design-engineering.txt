              The project proposes to target substantial numbers of African-American,
              low-income youth to provide opportunities for academic and career advancement
              in science, math, engineering and technology (SMET).  The project has three
              phases:  Phase 1) meet at the science center each week while engaging in 5
              learn and teach project cycles involving the design and building of simple
              technological devices;  Phase 2) uses experienced science educators to help
              teens with additional inquiry science investigations; Phase 3) teens will visit
              design clubs at preselected after-school program sites.  EDC will regularly
              develop curriculum booklets for three levels:  entry, coach and experienced
              teachers level (abstract).  SLSC will develop workplace competency materials to
              assist other science centers in teaching career confidence and qualities to
              teens, etc.  A total of 240 participants will participant in the program.
