              ABSTRACT

The main goal of the proposal is to develop new analytic methods to
              deal with the fundamental issue of global regularity for Nonlinear Wave
              Equations such as Wave Maps, Yang-Mills and the Einstein Vacuum Equations. We
              propose two specific problems to investigate. The first concerns the critical
              global well-posedness for Wave Maps and the second is to establish local well
              posedness in $H^2$ for the Einstein Vacuum equations.


Nonlinear Wave
              equations are at the heart of some of our basic physical theory such as General
              Relativity, Electrodynamics, Elasticity etc. Despite a lot of progress made
              throughout last century our knowledge of nonlinear waves remains rudimentary.
              The proposal outlines some directions in which we expect to make considerable
              progress. The main one concerns the Einstein field equations. It is well known
              that these equations can develop black holes and singularities. This fact makes
              it imperative to develop a theory  for rough solutions for these equations. 
              The Wave Maps equations can be viewed  as a simplified model problem  for the
              Einstein equations. We hope that a better understanding of rough solutions of
              these equations will help us make progress in connection to the former
              equations also.
