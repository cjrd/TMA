              Support is provided for the DIMACS workshop "Data depth: Robust multivariate
              analysis, computational geometry and applications" at Rutgers University. The
              workshop brings together theoretical and applied statisticians and computer
              scientists to promote and further the use and development of depth functions in
              nonparametric multivariate analysis. Data depth has applications in and
              connections with a number of different research areas, such as aviation safety,
              data compression, image analysis, data mining and analysis of genetic
              data.

The workshop addresses significant open conceptual issues and
              establishes perspective on applications. It also sets primary directions for
              further research, emphasizing the role of computational geometry in
              understanding concepts of and developing algorithms for data depth.
