              The atmospheric tides are global scale oscillations in the basic state of the
              Earths atmosphere (winds, temperature and density) that are forced in the
              lower-atmosphere and propagate vertically into the upper atmosphere and
              ionosphere. Over the past decade basic understanding of the migrating
              atmospheric tides has emerged, largely from an increase in the number of
              ground-based observatories across the globe making wind and temperature
              measurements of the mesosphere- and lower-thermosphere (MLT) roughly between 70
              and 120km. The continuing increase in the availability of observational data
              from ground and space based instruments is providing atmospheric scientists
              with the opportunity to improve their theoretical understanding of the
              mechanisms that drive atmospheric tides. This is accomplished through a process
              that includes both numerical models and observational data. The basic approach
              for this research is to use the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model
              (WACCM) that has been under development at the National Center for Atmospheric
              Research. WACCM is a fully nonlinear, four-dimensional global circulation model
              of the atmosphere spanning from the surface to an altitude of 140km. Analysis
              of WACCM results will be compared with the global network of MLT observations,
              including those from the recently launched TIMED spacecraft, to validate the
              tidal and planetary wave structure simulated by the model. Once validated, the
              model will be utilized to estimate the affect of global scale planetary waves
              on the structure of the atmospheric tides.
