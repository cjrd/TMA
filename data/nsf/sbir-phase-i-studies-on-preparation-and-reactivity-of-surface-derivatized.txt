              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new
              surface derivatized reactive nanoparticles. These nanoparticles  are expected
              to be highly active adsorbents and should be important in a number of
              applications. In the project, attention will be focused on preparing
              nanoparticles containing Lewis acid or base centers. The chemical modification
              involves introducing Lewis acidic boron or Lewis basic alkoxy functionalities
              on the surface of the nanoparticles. It is expected that introduction of such
              sites should enhance the adsorptive capability and the destructive ability of
              the nanoparticles appreciably. In particular, boron, by virtue of its affinity
              for electronegative atoms (in nerve agents) and the thio group (in mustard
              agent and nerve agent VX) should bind and help pull these agents quickly
              through the nanoparticles. Lewis basic sites should enhance the chemical
              reactivity of the nanoparticles thereby promoting destruction of agents by
              reactions such as elimination and/or hydrolysis.


Commercially, these
              materials will find application in both civilian and military markets; for
              example, in civilan markets as adsorbents in air filters for various industrial
              toxic agents, scrubbing agents for raw natural gas and as novel catalysts.
              Militarily, the new nanoparticles will provide  faster and more efficient
              decontamination of chemical warfare agents and environmental toxins.
